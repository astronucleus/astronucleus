Our country the Philippines identifies itself from the religion it acquired from Spain in 1521. To date Catholic churches and other religous groups still influence Filipinos on how to go on with their daily lives. Wars on the other hand destroyed the hope of people. Educational institutions on the other hand taught the public how to read, write and follow instructions.</p>\n<p>Tremendous numbers of Filipinos died in wars and crimes which instilled massive fear that is now being capitalized by media to sell their advertisements. </p>\n<p>A lot of my understanding of the issues in climate change were fortified with my experiences living in the islands for more than a year and acquiring a better understanding of the science of physics and astronomy - the language of the natural world. It is a very complex problem and needs tremendous effort from all of us. If not addressed within the decade…we will really face our extinction - a topic I will discuss in my next blog.</p>\n<p>This is the greatest threat to our existence and I feel the urgency of spreading knowledge and insights.  </p>","excerpt":"To continue with the climate change topic I posted a few days ago.. this post will further build upon how our species have greatly damaged…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/climate-change/","/tags/extinction-notes/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Humans toying with the natural world","tags":["climate change","extinction notes"],"date":"November 07, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/climate-change-the-longer-explanation/"}}
