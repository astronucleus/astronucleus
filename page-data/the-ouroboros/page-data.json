Our fear of snakes / serpents is one of the few embedded fears or “phobias” that we have, suggesting that stories and encounters about snakes have been repeatedly told to generations and enabled a some sort of “meme to gene encoding” and let early civilizations to encode the ouroboros in old texts or stone walls / tablets. </p>\n<p>Ancient people are able to understand that from disruptive events come out answers that no one in their wildest dreams can even imagine. Chaos and order are the dynamic structure in play in every situation - the death and rebirth in-loop with each other forever - yes it is one of the meta-truths. This got entangled as well with the acceptance of death as part of life in philosophical discussions like how the stoics describe it in the concept of <a href=\"https://tech-stoic.github.io/momento-mori\">memento mori</a>. </p>\n<p>I find the ouroboros fascinating enough to even see it in-play in our daily ways of life. The pandemic created unacceptable deaths but its pushing our limits to create newer technologies. Businesses got bankrupt but also new industries came out like mushrooms. We sacrifice our time to create art or build relationships with people and ourselves. The combination of chaos and order is truly a meta-structure of reality, interwooven in the fabric of how we navigate our lives. This is a great concept to ponder ideas from time to time especially in a time where there is tremendous disorder. Maybe there will be another great opportunity for humankind to lift the future forward.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/3d90e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100.13888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/4b3ab/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/f8bb1/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 148w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/900ac/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 295w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/4b3ab/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 590w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/3d90e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 720w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","excerpt":"Chaos and order, a concept that stood the test of time..
