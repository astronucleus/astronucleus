Peterson. It added more depth to my current structure of navigating the complexity of the future. If you want to try it check out this <a href=\"https://www.selfauthoring.com/future-authoring\">link</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>One Thing You Could Do Better</em></strong></p>\n<p>I would like to create more structure on my ideas - write more or talk about it in videos or podcasts.</p>\n<p>I believe this is where my abilities get strengthen as well as create opportunities for starting better conversations with society at large. I am currently developing my present space to do this better in the future or expand my capacity for doing similar things in the future but yeah the present is also a huge task all in its own.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Things to Learn About</em></strong></p>\n<p>Learning how to play the guitar has been on my bucket list for 35 years now and I’m taking incremental steps on tackling it. I wish to play my future wife a song or two and this will be a goal of mine this year. In five years, I wish to learn how to build a better platform in YouTube or my blog so I can spread better ideas and be a counter-culture to the narrative that is currently playing in society at large.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Improve Your Habits</em></strong></p>\n<p>What habits would you like to improve?</p>\n<p>At school? - I’m already working</p>\n<p>At work? - Maybe focus on improving my communication skills, listen more than too much speaking.</p>\n<p>With friends and family? Communicate more to them. This is ultimately hard for me to do especially that I’m quite far away from my home country.</p>\n<p>For your health? Run, Exercise and Eat well. Just continue to learn more about the Ketogenic diet. Prepare for the next marathon.</p>\n<p>With regards to smoking/alcohol/drug use? I will continue to do what I have started.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Your Social Life in the Future</em></strong></p>\n<p>I want to have friends that are listening to the kind of ideas that I truly believe and uphold. I guess modern society fails to harness people that are capable to do such now especially with social media and conventional news media pushing wrong narratives. I want to expand relationships with people who value gratitude, sacrifices, honesty and responsibility.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Your Leisure Activity in the Future</em></strong></p>\n<p>Art or learn how to write, draw, play the guitar - anything about improving my artistic capacity. I found to believe that the way I improved on this area of my abilities have enabled me to improve in other aspects of my life - work, ideation process, making connections with people and solving problems. I hope to continue again building the habit of writing, sketching and include playing the guitar - A LOT!!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Your Family Life in the Future</em></strong></p>\n<p>The kind of partner suitable for me is one that..</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have to be highly open minded - as most of what I do and think about is not for the average person</li>\n<li>Prioritizes health.</li>\n<li>Prioritizes building solutions or finding them instead of taking too much time on thinking about the problem.</li>\n<li>A risk taker - not as equal as mine but could risk herself loving an over the top risk taker like me.</li>\n<li>Likes to communicate her deep honest thoughts, trustworthy.</li>\n<li>TBC</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Your Career in the Future</em></strong></p>\n<p>Six months and Two years - Continue crushing at my work as an accountant in Cayman Islands</p>\n<p>Five years - I do not know how complex the answer but now I’m taking all steps to be as robust in the future so I have more options when the need arises. I can code, sing, write, communicate and I believe the more I improve- the more I can be of help for the future to any company or platform or advocacy.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Qualities You Admire</em></strong></p>\n<p>I admire Dr. Peterson a lot. He is so honest in his words and actions. He is very open to ideas and has a deep understanding of what he is talking about. He also admits that if he does not have answers to questions and is quite remarkable even for a person who have deep dived the question of who we really are as humans- it cuts across my soul to admire such remarkable courage in such admission.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Ideal Future</em></strong></p>\n<p>Who do you want to be? I want to be a responsible person for myself, for my wife/girlfriend, for my friends, for my family and society at large.</p>\n<p>What do you want to do? I want to be a net positive impact to everyone in my inner circle and society at large so whatever creative ability I have should be maximized as far as I can. I want to train my conscious and subconscious mind to improve my capacity to do more.</p>\n<p>Where do you want to end up? I want to end up where I can be of use for society and the future of humanity. It starts with my individual responsibilities up to my personal family and up to society at large. I want to help prove the truth that this is the best way forward for our own stories and even the future that is becoming to be increasingly complex.</p>\n<p>Why do you want these things? I believe this is the best things that I can achieve in my lifetime and can be passed on to future generations.</p>\n<p>How do you plan to achieve your goals? Training daily - focusing on improving my health, mind and body properly. Habits that matter, great habits that provide great results.</p>\n<p>When will you put your plans into action? I have started last year. I am continuing it even through - thus even trying this platform even so as to check if my structure is somewhat at par as the standards set by experts like. Dr. Jordan Peterson.</p>\n<p><strong><em>A Future to Avoid</em></strong></p>\n<p>I want to avoid not having a family of my own. This is not on par of the potential of each individual human being to bear life and be of part of a much bigger strata of participation to the game of life that started 3.5 billion years ago.</p>\n<p>I want to avoid not trying to become more creative. There is genuine productivity whenever I write, code and sketch. I also will not achieve the highest level of genetic lineage if I fail to access my untapped potential.</p>\n<p>I don’t want to die without being able to write or say what I needed to say to my family or society at large. Losing the opportunity for someone who can see more truth and not say them is a total loss to history in my estimation. I feel tremendous fear on this thought but I guess one of the key steps forward is writing about this like I’m doing now in this writing program.</p>\n<p>I am avoiding the potential in participating in catastrophic scale - climate denial, cognitive denial or even totalitarian or communism. We have watched a lot of suffering in the 20th century or even farther back into the past. We have totally paid this abundance in the modern society by tremendous amount of death - unquantifiable oceans of blood originating from millions and millions of years.</p>","excerpt":"I recently tried the future authoring program by Dr. Jordan B.
