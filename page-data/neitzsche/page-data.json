Hitler, Mao, Lenin capitalized on the weakness of the massess to comprehend what is true, casted fear and mayhem to distort their capacity to make the choices that could have prevented millions from dying. Yes, Friederick Neitzsche did predicted their footsteps lurking in to he future. Haunting and chilling forecast of how much dread will come in the 20th century.</p>\n<p>He did not have a crystal ball for his dire predictions. He had only a deep understanding of what makes us really who we are. His works became the basis of great works especially Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Dr. Jordan B. Peterson in the field of psychology. </p>\n<p>Yet, he said in some of his books that his works are not intended for all. He refers to “Higher men”, the few that can really understand the deep shackles that entangles us. The selected men can only comprehend how fragile the world is.</p>\n<p>The past week I have deep dived into some of his works. I have had always this understanding of myself that I somehow have the unique ability to understand deep concepts like computer science, biology, neuroscience or astronomy… but Neitzsche’s works kind of terrified me. He laid out the frailities of us especially describing that most men are composed as “herd animals” and they drive the results of society at large. Two world wars and totalitarian states have created oceans of blood that is horrifying to even account for…Now I’m lead to thinking, where is my position to his works?</p>\n<p>For now what is self evident is to somehow understand it. Writing about it could be another path like the one I’m doing now. But I do not know if I fit the bill of a man that can be in that select group that he describes. Am I that special?</p>\n<p>I’ll be needing more time to answer this question. Need to get a grasp of all his books and works. I have time for now to deep dive in to the world of a mad man, one of the few great men our species was able to produce..</p>","excerpt":"I’m drawn to his works and depth, he is truly an artistic poet that warned the few that really understands..
