But unique to us as humans is the ability to visualize the past, forecastthe future and use it as a reference for the present. As I sift to Neitzsche’s philosophy in Beyond Good and Evil (BGE) - I press on to the structure of how I think, or rather how “I thought I think”. </p>\n<p>What is so fascinating is the deep embeded knowledge that I have honed for the past years were fine tuned and better footholds are starting to emerge our of reading this book. Completely I’m trying to frame all of my activities or actions to serving the fundamental value of what keeps the universe engaging - preserving life or to serve life as the primary code of conduct moving forward. Convincing myself was not that difficult but strategizing the sphere of my influence is the next agenda - which I am curious of how things will definitely go. </p>\n<p>I wish I had read this book a year ago even. It could have crystalized a better understanding of how I should act and move into the future. I am now reviewing my current trajectory…as I see more potential in me than there ever was available… It will be an interesting years to come and I am thrilled to do the process of uncovering such.</p>\n<p>Knowledge is this elusive sword and shield that we use to make our daily problems get solved…but there is no correct way of acquiring and using such? I guess that is what Neitzsche is trying to make as a counter argument - there is a better way of understanding how we do things and we just have to accept that we have that power to do such and understand the value of doing good not only for ourselves but for others and the future. Again I should write more deeper thoughts about this book.</p>","excerpt":"Is the will to truth in us is something that we fully understand? it bothered me a bit after reading Neitzsche’s writings in BGE..that even…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Do we understand how we crave for knowledge?","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art"],"date":"February 03, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/will-to-truth/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
