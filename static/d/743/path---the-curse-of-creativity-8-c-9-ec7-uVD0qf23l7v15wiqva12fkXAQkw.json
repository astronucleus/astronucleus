Dr. Jordan Peterson coined a this as a curse, the curse of creativity. He explains that it is one of the worst talents that you can have. It is very difficult to create an identity for yourself as your constant fascination constantly drag you to different directions. Another thing is creativity is very very difficult to monetize and make as a career..</p>\n<p>His explanation was my a narrative that played for the past two years. I sure did enjoy doing the following jobs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>vlogger </li>\n<li>blogger</li>\n<li>social media marketer </li>\n<li>web developer</li>\n<li>blockchain developer</li>\n<li>marketing and business development head</li>\n<li>drone operator</li>\n<li>construction supervisor</li>\n<li>video editor  </li>\n<li>accountant </li>\n<li>tour guide  </li>\n<li>historian</li>\n<li>camp volunteer</li>\n<li>finance manager</li>\n<li>entrepreneur</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the eyes of many, they couldn’t understand what I was doing. </p>\n<p>For me, I was only doing what I think was really good to try.. I simply tried doing the fun stuff. There were a lot of good and bad in it. I just don’t want to regret that I did not pursue trying when I had the health, wealth and time to experiment. I faced the demons inside of me, those noises that stops us from acting.. I handled fear by talking to it constantly. </p>\n<p><em>I lost a ton of money. I gained a lot of experience. I ignored great advices, but learned thereafter..</em></p>\n<p>The process was excruciatingly risky and comfortable after I accepted the uncomfortable side of it. I did helped creating a hostel and provide jobs to people and made an impact to the friends that I met along the way.. Good or bad, I know that I was able to share a different dynamic to viewing the world. These are things that I’m most proud of.</p>\n<p>But yeah, this curse is unique to me, most especially in my cultural heritage as a Filipino. </p>","excerpt":"This blog post have puzzled me for months, probably have made a different version of some type of it in the past..
