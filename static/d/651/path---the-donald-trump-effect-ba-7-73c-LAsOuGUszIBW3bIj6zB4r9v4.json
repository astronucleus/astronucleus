That is crazy to think that he got around 2 billion dollars worth of free publicity through his rethorics. Social media magnified the problem through its ability to consume the people’s attention 24/7. This a big hole in the way majority of us view the world as we forgot how to think and analyze what is truly beneficial to talk about.. Another example why I keep saying most people are like zombies nowadays. I got in to a heated argument with a girl in Thailand before by just explaining how I have perceived of him winning the election against another bad apple - Hilary Clinton. </li>\n<li><b>Lying becomes the new normal.</b> He is insane, not insidious - yet. He keeps talking about putting a wall to guard Mexico from bringing drugs and guns to his country. He speaks of it like it is a crisis that his country needs to pay attention but he still keeps golfing on the weekend for 6 hours.. He’s delusion about what he want’s to promote as a right he acquired from winning the old office is so amazing and stupid at the same time that the strongest economy in the world is being ran by a guy that is full of shit. I had a friend whom I met in Palawan from the US wherein she had gone traveling since Trump won and she basically doesn’t want to comeback until things change.</li>\n<li><b>Climate Change Denial.</b></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Wherever you live in this world, Donald Trump has affected your life in a way, mostly bad.
