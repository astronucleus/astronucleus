I could have been too attached to a great 2019 and making new plans on top of my plans this year had me out of sync. I also can’t comprehend the idea that there is such chance that most of the people I know back home can die. </p>\n<p>But this should not be my way of perceiving what is happening. I have to get back to my proper frame of thinking to become as effective as I can be during this crisis. So I should properly account my understanding to what is happening to myself. I have to settle some questions in my head…namely…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How is my health at risk in this crisis?</li>\n<li>How can I be a problem during this crisis?</li>\n<li>Am I panicking or developing anxieties?</li>\n<li>How can I adapt to the uncertainty…?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fuck this virus!!! I should go back learning stuff…I might tap into my doomsday prepping skills now…</p>\n<p>What I should do is…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue building great habits built on cognitive strenghtening</li>\n<li>Continue to make healh and mind an utmost priority…</li>\n<li>Also develop and invigorate the PLAN - a resilience plan..</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is this PLAN? for now this includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a backyard garden. </li>\n<li>Make and test tools that can offset for possibility of dwindling supplies from US (Fishing gear, Y slingshot, hmmmm what more).</li>\n<li>Map immediate resource locations in the island.</li>\n<li>Learn new adaptive skills (this I need to figure out still…)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hopefully this refocusing on managing the situation will add an additional layer on how I can keep myself occupied and not focus on the downsides of this chaos. I should build more on this PLAN as the days go by…</p>","excerpt":"I can’t let this virus stop me from being me..
