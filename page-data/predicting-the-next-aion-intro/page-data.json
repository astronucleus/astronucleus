I’m terrified that our attempt to use the scientific method will ultimately fail and millions will literally suffer and die. These are stark ideas that I am so uncertain that I needed to write everything I am capable of understanding or not understanding.</p>\n<p>But why I am the right person to write about these kinds of things, attempting the feat of a prophet or messiah. I am an ordinary accountant from the third world. The unique thing for my case that could help in these attempt is my tremendous passion to understand my curiosities have cracked a hole into absurdity that I stand with the few who can understand multiple sets of contradicting perspectives, may it be in biology, programming, business, economics, neuroscience, philosophy…what I’m trying to say is I’m highly open minded to any kind of problem solving methods. But the sad part of this gift (or burden) is I somehow see through far into the future, and all I can see are the problems, those that can be solved by our modern methods and technologies and those that we cannot despite our ability to do so.</p>\n<p>I can see this book becoming too terrifying for the average person to read. If you are diagnosed with a psychological disorder or under duress or stress - please read with tremendous caution. But if you have time to see the future in a perspective of a highly open minded person - you might find tremendous benefit from this book. </p>\n<p>I am aiming to answer my fears, outline them and disect each part after the other. I find that this limited time that I have to do this so is enough to force me to write into the night after my days work as an accountant. </p>\n<p>I also recently finished Carl Jung’s book Aion. It was a crazy book. It was something only few can digest. I do not even have the grasp of reality after digesting the contents of it. I lost some taste to my normal routine of consuming a lot of diverging discussions realm of podcasting. But what I might be taking from Aion is somewhat similar as Carl Jung attempted to set a discussion that there is a polarizing imbalance in how we are laying out society. This view is very unpopular at the time that it was provided in the western world. But now, he’s thoughts are resonating in Dr. Jordan Peterson’s books, lectures and interviews. The crack in the disconnection in society is so large that the metaphysical lack is eating up human nature itself - those who are incapable of exercising critical thinking or control are becoming consumed by dangerous ideologies. This cloud of confusion is hindering us from banding together to correct a lot of our mistakes in destroying the natural world, preparing for the technological disruptions and even avoiding the threats of WW3. I will layout my analyses to why I have arrived to such words.</p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic have triggered a chain of events that we are not aware where it will end up. We have clearly released a demon that is so forceful that we will not be able to contain it moving forward into the future. </p>\n<p>TBC.</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"DRAFT I’m trying to understand what is happening… I am terrified of what the world is not capable of understanding.
