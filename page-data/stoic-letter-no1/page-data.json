You ought to find some luck in between the madness this world is in and continuing to dwell in. You managed well despite seeing true evil at its claws behind the back of your head. How do you come up with such gut feel decisions and evade the worsts? </p>\n<p>You are some kind of crazy animal that can do a lot more, do not forget that. You code, fly drones, run fast, write well than most, knows how to edit videos, you can read human emotions far better than others and focus extensively to learn music and sketching digital arts… you know you have been blessed with tremendous focus - use it properly, to aid yourslelf and society.</p>\n<p>Discover the net effects of your potential, until your last breath. Train hard, work hard. Speak the truth. Love and not hate. Listen more and less words to avoid mistakes. Speak when necessary. Eat well, take precaution in everything you do. Do calculated risks. Do not procastinate and think critically. Be resourceful and learn more than you can learn. You do not have much time so focus is warranted in everything you do, your individual responsibilty is part of the hope..</p>\n<p>You are part of the hope of this world.

You are an enabler of life for yourself and others - including future generations. </p>\n<p>Again thanks for not fucking up more than what you did before..</p>\n<p>Miguel</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kicking of a new series of stoic based letters to various people, ideas and events…</em></strong></p>","excerpt":"The average person is insane enough to not talk to himself… Hey Miguel, You ought to have been blessed a second chance, a second chance at…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/stoic-letters/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"A stoic letter, a letter to myself","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","stoic-letters"],"date":"October 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/stoic-letter-no1/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
