I’m in fear that I make a dumb move that will hinder me from adapting to what can happen. This might just be over thinking or am I going insane? I’m pretty sure I am not…</p>\n<p>Let me outline why I am not crazy and not over thinking what can play out in the future. I naturally gravitate to any form of information. Each pattern, idea or experience gives me a certain piece that I can find relevance to the grand scheme of things. What are these things that are in play that I am being drawn into?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technological disruptions - Artificial intelligence analyzing our daily clicks and searches, disruption in the job markets</li>\n<li>Ideological constructs - Postmodernism, polictical divide, geopolitics, capitalism going corrupt, marxism and socialism</li>\n<li>Climate disruption due to excessive use of non-renewable resources</li>\n<li>Poor health at scale - sugar and carbohydrates, overuse of antibiotics, medical fields becoming corrupt</li>\n<li>Threat of war - China vs. the world</li>\n<li>The effect of COVID to the economy and immigration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a lot of things still that bothers me, yet this list is tremendously big enough to understand. Maybe drafting a book about trying to understand these forces is a great idea. Maybe this might tip myself to insanity instead? I guess not. I should write more about this. </p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"I’m still struggling to understand what is happening in the world now…too many factors to concider on to what direction I can take…I’m…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/rational-stoic/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Drafting a book?","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","rational-stoic"],"date":"July 12, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/writing-a-draft-for-book/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
