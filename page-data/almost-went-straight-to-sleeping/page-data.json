Writing is unbelievably useful, that is why I force my brain and body a structure of breaking down ideas into letters, words, paragraphs, stories or blogs that eventually can make me a better communicator of ideas. </p>\n<p>I haven’t seen profound effects of my writing except in my job here in Cayman Islands where my ability to be better at explaining ideas in emails or group chats. I had improved but not to a level where I can write a book or layout captivating blogs - I really do feel I have a shitty blog.</p>\n<p>But even if this shitty blog is at its current form or state…it is a building block to getting better at it…this is the same pattern that was adapted by the greatest writers too - write all the time, whenever they can…it builds over time. Yes, incremental increase over time makes life better.</p>\n<p>The truth is I still haven’t made the escape velocity of my dependence to my skills as an accountant but yeah, I am trying to punch a hole into other fields of expertise to somehow see what sticks or converge as combination of skills or produce opportunities to increase my resources.</p>\n<p>This is not a bad blog post after all. Not bad for my 8th straight of blogging…</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/3d90e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100.13888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/4b3ab/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/f8bb1/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 148w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/900ac/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 295w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/4b3ab/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 590w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/3d90e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 720w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","excerpt":"Writing for seven days straight formed a structure for me to remember that I need to write atleast something tonight…ß Well, another loose…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/rational-stoic/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Almost went straight to sleep","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","rational-stoic"],"date":"July 07, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/almost-went-straight-to-sleeping/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
