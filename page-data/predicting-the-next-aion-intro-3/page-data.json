I’m terrified that our attempt to use the science as a frame for solving all our of problems will ultimately fail and millions will literally suffer and die. These are stark ideas that I am so uncertain that I needed to write everything I am capable of understanding and the ones I cannot…these ideas I’m drafting in my blog, will go into a book - summarizing the pain of this coginitive pursuit I never thought of doing. </p>\n<p>But why I am the right person to write about these looming dangers or even attempting the feat of a prophet or messiah? I am an ordinary accountant from a third world country the Philippines. I did not originate from a wealthy family nor got lucky in the genetic lottery. All I know that is unique about me is I have a deep passion to understand my curiosities and wherever it leads me most of the time seem pressing at the moment.</p>\n<p>My curiosity have cracked a hole into absurdity that the frame of deep tomes of knowledge I tried to knaw my teeth with allowe me to stand with the few who can understand multiple sets of contradicting perspectives, may it be in biology, computer programming, business, economics, neuroscience, philosophy…what I’m trying to say is I’m highly open minded to any kind of problem solving methods. But the saddest part of this gift (or burden) is I somehow see far into the future and all I can see are the problems. Blood and suffering to be exact. We are losing the grip to what made the past 70 years the best period in human history. The multi-variant problem of a degenerating society is now at our grasp. </p>\n<p>We lack the societal design to solve what are often times in front of us. To develop modern methods and technologies that solve bleak realities like plastic pollution or climate change, our minds are preoccupied with so many tiny unimportant and important decisions that drives our second by second activities, thus ignoring the lurking doom happening now that increasingly vacuums us to tremendous uncertainty.</p>\n<p>I deal with these self talk everyday. Even though as I try to live like a stoic and feeling okay most of the time and living as part of the richest group of people that ever walked the face of the planet as judge by historical standards, what demons that will come out from our past decisions keeps me thinking like a crackpot almost all the time. </p>\n<p>I fear for myself but I fear more for people whom have invested their whole life to mediocrity. A poor recognition of meta and phyisical reality can greatly affect one’s fate, let alone at societal level where the average person thrives in the mediocrity of losing their time in a handheld device.</p>\n<p>I can see this book becoming too terrifying for the average person to read. If you are diagnosed with a psychological disorder or under duress or stress - please read with tremendous caution. But I’m very grateful that if you decided to join me in this journey of seeking the solutions or complexities of the next five to ten years - you might find tremendous benefit from this book. Most book fail to relate the current dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic and I will try to add that layer to the topics that have been discussed in the last fifty years by experts on history and the sciences.</p>\n<p>I am aiming to answer my fears, outline them and disect each part after the other. I find that this limited time that I have to do this so is enough to force me to write into the night after my days work as an accountant. I recently finished Carl Jung’s book - Aion. It was a crazy book. I do not even have the grasp of reality after digesting the contents of it. I lost some taste to my normal routine of consuming a lot of diverging discussions in Jung’s realm. But what I might be taking from Aion is somewhat similar as Carl Jung attempted to set a discussion starting from the 1950s, explaining in his various books that there is a polarizing imbalance in how we are laying out the foundations of society as a whole. </p>\n<p>This view is very unpopular at the time that it was provided in the western world. But now, he’s thoughts are resonating in Dr. Jordan Peterson’s books, lectures and interviews. The crack in the disconnection in society is so large that the metaphysical lack is eating up human nature itself - those who are incapable of exercising critical thinking or control are becoming consumed by dangerous ideologies. This cloud of confusion is hindering us from banding together to correct a lot of our mistakes in destroying the natural world, preparing for the technological disruptions and even avoiding the threats of WW3. I will layout my analyses to why I have arrived to such words.</p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic have triggered a chain of events that we are not aware where it will end up. We have clearly released a demon forcing to us to bleed each drop of progress the 20th century have achieved. I hope to be able to explain everything to myself. I hope I’m intelligent enough to discover a the answers I’m seeking to understand the insanity..</p>\n<p>TBC.</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"The multi-variant problem of a degenerating society..
