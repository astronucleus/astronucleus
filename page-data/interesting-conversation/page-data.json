I needed to show the customer we had that somehow I’m trying to differenitate from the norm for years now and still is going through the journey of dealing with the murky swamp of ideologies of other people coliding to my own understanding of what is going on.</p>\n<p>What intrigued me is he has the same outlook of the future - a bleak one where we are in the beginning of a complete reorganization of history and it will get worse than it gets better.. I needed to explain and dig deeper, but there was some part that we did not agree much. For him its okay for us to go back to a survival of the fittest era…but I do not agree to that as I have subscribed and deeply understood what Dr. Peterson said about our capacity as sa civilization to cause harm and danger is so high because of our high technological capacity. I do not want society going to throw away all the great things that we have achieved just because we can start all over again, I bloody cannot be part of that. </p>\n<p>It was a great conversation, I literally get to see myself trying to come up of great arguments to defend myself. Even if I do not have control over his opinion… I bet somehow I gave bits of information that show there is hope…even though of a bleak view of the world. I guess he have had so much dopamine and cortisol kick from bad media sources but yeah I can be wrong about my low resolution understanding of his choices of words…</p>\n<p>Another writing to wrap up my day. This was not my intended topic yet I did wrote a lot about it to put on record how I have understood myself, the customer and the forces both natural world and the meta-physical realm at play. But yeah, my personal grip on the a bleak path humanity is heading into after the pandemic is growing louder and louder in my daily self-talk.</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"Someone thought I was a post-modernist…I immediately needed to dig deeper… People normally think I am crazy because I deep dive to a lot of…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/rational-stoic/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"An interesting conversation","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","rational-stoic"],"date":"July 08, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/interesting-conversation/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
