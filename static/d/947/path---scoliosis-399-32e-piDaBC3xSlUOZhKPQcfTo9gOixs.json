Some say its genetic or triggered by the person’s environment but the sources I’ve read is not clear. I just feel victimized by how I learned about my case. I had a medical inspection two months ago that included checking my back. Why was it not even mentioned? Is the medical community designed to conceal information until a certain case problem is big enough to bring a patient back for profits? My case is not painful so it is not a big concern yet.</p>\n<p>I normally reflect on death and how fragile our lives can be. That is why I do a lot of exercises to maintain a capable body. I eat consciously. Do not put sugar in my coffee. I love a strong and healthy anatomy because it equates to a strong and healthy mind. The good thing about me learning about my scoliosis is I now have a reason to do yoga. Did some specific exercises targeted for my case and I felt really good after. I still need to improve my core muscles so yeah this turned out to be a positive thing. Discipline is crucial.</p>","excerpt":"I hope I illustrated the x-ray properly from my memory.
