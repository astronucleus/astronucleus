Elon Musk further stressed that an super intelligent computer system can spread misinformation to alter votes or improve market prices of shares of a given company. Sam Harris tells the same arguement as if there will be a company like google or facebook that will be able to create an ai that can improve or change itself or other computer programs, Russia or China won’t hesitate to fly nuclear rockets to Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p>Most would think that they are insane but I do understand when a genie is out of the box, there is no point of turning back. A super intelligent computer system is capable of computing 20,000 years worth of human operation in a week. It is impossible to stop that kind of ability of efficiency. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s alarming that the whole world is not acting on monitoring the progress of artificial intelligence. We just let google and social media platforms mine our searches, likes and posts for the purpose of building their AI systems.\nHuman nature tends to ignore something they do not understand, like what is happening to our climate and it’s current state (another blog to expand this..). </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you wish to read on this and educate yourself further..\nRead <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742\">Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom</a>. a tough read but it is full of information dedicated to AI and its danger..</p>\n<p>Watch these:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra3fv8gl6NE\">Elon Musk on AI</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BChxQHyFIOI\">Sam Harriss on AI</a>\nThese two videos can explain further and better than I am so they’re both worth watching..</p>","excerpt":"I have been doing a deep dive in my direction for the years to come and I have stumbled in two of Joe Rogan’s interview with Elon Musk and…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/super-intelligence/","/tags/ai/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"AI danger","tags":["super intelligence","ai"],"date":"October 22, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/AI-danger/"}}
