The death of George Floyd through the hands of Derek Chauvin, a police officer pinning his neck to his knees is really unacceptable in all facets and yeah the members of black community has been oppressed since the time of colonization but what is unfolding after this event is really something that I did not expect to emerge. The right to freedom of speech is necessary for us to move society into correcting its errors and now we are seeing protests that does focus on his death as a due of racism ONLY. Putting all issues in one bucket and claim that it is due to one factor is bad and will not produce solutions.</p>\n<p>And yet here we are putting all the blame on oppression as a case of racism. The world is just coming of the first wave of the coronavirus then it will be engulfed again by a new virus - somekind of mind virus. To say that the world is in a state of cognitive collapse can now become sounding as a racial discrimination. The freedom of speech that we so need the most evolves now to a postmodernism ideology where everybody talking is right. This is completely horrible, when everybody is right…no one can be wrong? Where we have the ability to breakdown bad statements before, now everything is right even if the person telling you what is right never have really lived or tested the concepts what he / she is saying. The cognitive dominos are rolling now and the way I see it - the noise that covers all people now that thinking they are oppressed are so much that is hindering them from critically analyzing themselves, unable to see that they are wrong. </p>\n<p>It is hard to understand that what you are believing is wrong especially when the ideas engulfing your mind are more powerful than your ability to think critically. This is now an observeable reality for most who waste their time in consuming news and social media. As most of these platforms have their own biases, these transfer of belief systems instead capture our own beliefs, and thus resulting to us outsourcing our critical thinking capabilities to either journalists, universities or algorithms. We are living in a hyperactivity in polarizing systems that forces us to adapt in ways that it hard to see where is it leading. We can go tribal again but it is clear that we have to let go og what made us so human in the past 70 years. There will be blood. I hate to see that this can become that the narrative that will unfold in the US - they just formed a country within Seattle last week, how crazy the times have become in two weeks. Another looming result of the protests is tyranny by totalitarian ideologies unfolding. The far right can impose power and we have gone this road before and have millions of people dead as a result. </p>\n<p>Clearly, it looks that our ability to think critically is in shambles. I thought a year ago that the way we think is not in threat and the natural world only is. Now, we are on a brink of throwing the western culture in exchange of low resolution thinking that will destroy us and what worries me is we need that mode of thinking in the coming years to help fix the climate problem. </p>\n<p>I can’t believe what is happening..</p>","excerpt":"Instead of focusing on creating content for  Rational Stoic , this movement engulfing the world caught my attention..
