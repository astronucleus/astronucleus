Discipline became harder for me to catch especially when the doom and loom of a pandemic laced world is very hard to negate. As blessed as I was in my grasp in understanding reality…accepting that the world is in a very dire state…its so crazy for me to digest. </p>\n<p>I understand how economic collapse does not favor the lower levels of society. I understand computer code as it continues to power certain organizations and keep us in the loop with constant disturbances with the black mirrors in our pockets. I have lived long enough in islands and constantly see how the climate is changing plus the pollution that we keep on putting to the oceans. It is very troubling, tons of different problems that needs to be addressed are happening all at the same time…</p>\n<p>This is a reason that forces me to write more as maybe my pursuit to making content online might tilt some of the conversations so I can open up people’s minds especially in my sphere of influence. Stopping and letting things flow out of control I feel is so stupid and a stance that I will not grab for myself. I have been fortunate enough to live a life of a king (per historical standards, the resources I’m amassing currently makes me one of the richest people ever to walk in history…) and push to literally anything I wished to pursue without shackles and I would not let the sphere of influence that I can reach be destroyed by being passive. </p>\n<p>Doing more is the way forward. Creating more from the resources within my grasp is the PLAN. I am also considering hiring a writer for this blog. That is an option I’m keeping in my sleeve. I can pay someone for some articles that I can review every now and then. Not a bad idea. Lets see how things get going here in Cayman Islands, If I can get a stable status for the next year here, hiring another extra arm for my content stuff can extend my reach. Plus I get to help another soul. Hmmmmm. not a bad idea. Let’s explore this idea in the coming days or weeks…</p>","excerpt":"Trying to get things going again with writing..
