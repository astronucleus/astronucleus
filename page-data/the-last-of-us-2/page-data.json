He tried a very realistic approach on a narrative that may or may not work to the gaming community. From a capitalist perspective, losing consumers of your gaming content could spiral to less profit or negative publicity. From a stoic view where I largely gravitate with - TLOU2’s realism to its adaptation on portraying mental health, the concept of death and bad choices were put together perfectly.</p>\n<p>The technology of video games makes us owners of the games we buy, yet it is truly not ours to decide how the game is created or the story will be adapted - who gets to live and who gets to die. Yet this online clash happening because of the choices Neil and Naughty Dog took as the developer is so real for most gamers. I guess not all have seen and studied enough like I do and will clearly not be able to project a layer of abstraction that can remove the entanglement of the neuroscience behind our grip on gaming. </p>\n<p>I will definitely play the game in the next years, but now is not the time. I will be more than happy to revisit these ideas I have written here. </p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"I kind of personally liked how the plot of the game narrative pushed on after Abby killed Joel..
