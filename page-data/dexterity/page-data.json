I practically ground my ideas now in how our ancestors walked through time and navigate their day-to-day lives in their primal state. I am constantly seeking resources, books, audio talks, podcasts and videos that will build on how evolution played to our favor to become the apex animal - able to mold the world to our own interests.</p>\n<p>One book I’m trying to navigate now is Robert Greene’s Mastery - such a famous book for harnessing one’s true potential and social capacity. I was amazed of myself really…I should have listened or read this book from the start. It has a great depth on utralearning and has a lot of biological material to support the concepts, no wonder a lot of learners tend to recommend this book a lot.</p>\n<p>The book cited the role of our hands to have its own structure and aid our active learning, helping build the brain as we feel what we do on a constant manner. We build neural pathways whenever we make use of our two hands. I got curious now on how to build on this idea. I bought a guitar a year ago and now I’m using it to try and learn music, for now…developing a habit of doing some musical taps every night helps me little by little and I’m quite curious on where it will lead me too. I get to maintain a fixed schedule as well for sketching with my galaxy note. Quite an experience to build something from scratch and thus being benefited of some workable materials for this blog. Coding is another thing as translating different information for this blog has been a satisfying experience itself. It gives me a different perspective on how to see the world.</p>\n<p>I’m sure this will lead me to vast improvements in my ability to learn. Active movements and the increased use of my fingertips will make connections never have been established before. Taking ultralearning as an addiction as proven to be very helpful..especially as chaos lurks to engulf our silence all the time.</p>","excerpt":"We evolved to be the top predator and it has a lot to on how we developed and used our hands..
