Writing is unbelievably useful, that is why I force my brain and body a structure of breaking down ideas into letters, words, paragraphs, stories or blogs that eventually can make me a better communicator of ideas. </p>\n<p>I haven’t seen profound effects of my writing except in my job here in Cayman Islands where my ability to be better at explaining ideas in emails or group chats. I had improved but not to a level where I can write a book or layout captivating blogs - I really do feel I have a shitty blog.</p>\n<p>But even if this shitty blog is at its current form or state…it is a building block to getting better at it…this is the same pattern that was adapted by the greatest writers too - write all the time, whenever they can…it builds over time. Yes, incremental increase over time makes life better.</p>\n<p>The truth is I still haven’t made the escape velocity of my dependence to my skills as an accountant but yeah, I am trying to punch a hole into other fields of expertise to somehow see what sticks or converge as combination of skills or produce opportunities to increase my resources.</p>\n<p>This is not a bad blog post after all. Not bad for my 8th straight of blogging…</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"Writing for seven days straight formed a structure for me to remember that I need to write atleast something tonight…ß Well, another loose…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/rational-stoic/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Almost went straight to sleep","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","rational-stoic"],"date":"July 07, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/almost-went-straight-to-sleeping/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
