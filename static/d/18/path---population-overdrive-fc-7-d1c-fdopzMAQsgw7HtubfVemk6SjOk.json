Most of these problems are sourced out to businesses that operate for a profit - hence. More consumption, more profit, more products, better services - the cycle repeats itself over and over.  </p>\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQE--AdhiXCxcWCg6H1x1MDYDE-Si_r6NU91UUyF1mWqnVkYK6i\" alt=\"foodwaste\" style=\"width: 700px\">\n<p>I find this very alarming due to the amount of resources needed to sustain our wants and needs. I was watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlxySFrkIM\">a short video done by Climate lab and Vox</a> on food wastage and to my shock - we throw everyday 40% of the food that we produce. This is still edible! That’s crazy!!!</p>\n<p>We are approximately 7.7 billion already, growing at a pace of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=rate+of+increase+in+population&#x26;rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH738PH738&#x26;oq=rate+of+increase+in+&#x26;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.10772j0j7&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8\">1.07% per year</a>. It is catastrophic if all humans on earth would try to live like an average american. Experts thinks that we need <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33133712\">four earths</a> to accomodate the natural resources needed.</p>\n<img src=\"\" alt=\"charlesdawrwin\" style=\"width: 700px\">\nI find it amazing to reflect on the idea of natural selection theorized by Charles Darwin. We came to a point where a specie can create complex systems just to support the population. \n<p>But where does this system of capitalism will take us?
