Most of these needs are sourced out to businesses that operate for a profit - hence. More consumption, more profit, more products,  better services - the cycle repeats itself over and over. </p>\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQE--AdhiXCxcWCg6H1x1MDYDE-Si_r6NU91UUyF1mWqnVkYK6i\" alt=\"foodwaste\" style=\"width: 700px\">\nI find this very alarming due to the amount of resources needed to sustain our wants and needs. I was watching a short video done by [Climate lab and Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlxySFrkIM) on food wastage and to my shock - we throw everyday 40% of the food that we produce.

Experts thinks that we need <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33133712\">four earths</a> to accomodate the natural resources needed.</p>\n<p>I find it amazing to reflect on the idea of natural selection theorized by Charles Darwin. We came to a point where a specie can create complex systems just to support the population. </p>\n<img src=\"\" alt=\"long-term_travel\" style=\"width: 700px\">\n<p>But where does this system of capitalism will take us?
