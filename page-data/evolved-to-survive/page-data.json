We are wired to solve problems and move forward into the future. If you are like the average person, have you ever encountered asking yourself why you hate complex problems? Math. Physics. Contracts. Tax. Computers errors. Your car breaking down. </p>\n<p>I bet you get my point. An easy life is staying away from too much complexity. </p>\n<p>But, there is a better way of understanding our tendency to not force ourselves to the complexity of any problem. We are evolved to do less thinking as much as possible. This have proven to be the hallmark of our human existence as we have thrived to dilluting any situation to a minimum, we configured so much profound discoveries in the past 10,000 years that enabled the modern living so easy.</p>\n<p>Evolutionary science is very conceptual as one cannot go back in the past to just verify every bit of information that is available. But to derive a phenomenon from subsets of evidences have became the hallmark of how life came to be in this planet. Charles Darwin discovered it after his journey in the Galapagos islands. Different islands yielded different adaptations for the birds called Finches. Some have stronger beaks for breaking nuts while others did not need such feature resulting to smaller beaks. </p>\n<p>Variations across the same species over thousands (or even millions) of years enabled the creation of new species. That is how the story of life on earth has came about. It took one billion years from the big bang to create single celled organisms that later become multi-cellular and later become fish, then rats, then apes, then homo sapiens - Us. This might seem so absurd to you how life on earth is created as this abstraction seems so unbelievable but darwinian theory is the best we’ve got in explaining this slow moving proces of species trying to move forward their kind into the future.</p>\n<p>Survival of the fittest is a narrative, the overlaying game of all to some respects. The natural world is harder to understand nowadays as modern society tries to cluster into cities or much worse is spending too much time with our smarthones. Yet evolution is still at play and we cannot deny the fact that we are biological creatures, trying to move forward into the future. We learned how to defend ourselves using spears and stones, cook our wood through fire, built farms that feed so villages and castle walls that protect the citizens. Through this rolling process of improving technology and scientific research we are now in a position in the 20th century where you can potentially wire your brain directly to the internet and harness the data google have and become a walking library or university. Our strive to solve fundamental problems, however small they are across millenia became the driving force to the thriving of the genus homo. We are the biggest badass predator ever to walk the face of the planet.</p>\n<p>But it would be so dumb to think that we are the center of the universe, thinking that yeah we made it to the 20th century and let us close the history books. The mere fact that a pandemic can still happen despite the advanced medical science we have, we can’t just dispense how fragile our center of the universe is. An evolutionary view of everything we do - walking, running, talking, eating, sex, thinking, sleeping, working becomes more profound if you factor that in each activity is built by tiny changes (good or bad) over long stretches of time. </p>\n<p>(Heavy writing, a great rough draft of ideas about evolutionary thinking…)</p>","excerpt":"DRAFT People don’t want to lose their frame of reference.
