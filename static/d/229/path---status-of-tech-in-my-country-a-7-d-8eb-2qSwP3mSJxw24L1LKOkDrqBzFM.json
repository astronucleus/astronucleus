As the under-educated population gets bigger and bigger, it then magnifies the problem leading to more loses in time, money, opportunity and even lives. What I mean by under-educated Filipinos are the ones who decide to just complain about the situation and just follow media advertisements and news (this is why I don’t watch the news at all).</p>\n<p>History shows that the most improvements we had in the last 1.8 million years of existence were achieved in the past 400 years, all attributable to technology. I would like to think that technology is a “mindset”. Using old methods to solve the same old problems will always have the same outcome. Innovation is a must if one will want a more favorable result. </p>\n<p>I applaud the current government for its accomplishment in solving some of our problems but still I see that even the government is very slow to adapt new solutions being used in other countries. Sadly, the way for new laws to be implemented..it takes a lot of time. A large part of congress also have their self-interests are first prioritize instead of the nation. </p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html\">Google, Apple and other companies</a> have already declared that they don’t need a degree for certain professions to hire.</p>","excerpt":"I’d like to think that the Philippines is driven by media and old industry practices.
