To be honest, I did not expect to get hired this month because it is a busy month here in the Philippines but yeah I guess luck favored my grit again to search and dig through rough situations. </p>\n<p>I really forgot that I applied a job Accounting in the Cayman Islands. That is why that when they called, I literally am scratching my head wondering how I got the interview. But yeah, I did pass the interview and got a good deal with them. I intend to stay in Cayman Islands or the next three years (or could be more..). </p>\n<p>A fresh start for rebuilding my financial curve again. The universe surely know how to make miracles. I think I can conveniently push to myself to do keto diet and ride bicycles everyday there. Pretty excited of the new challenge. </p>\n<p>It’s my third time staying in an island for more than 11 months though.. </p>","excerpt":"I have been busy the past week through the christmas rush because I am fixing all of my papers for a temporary work permit going to the…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/personal/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"I got hired in Cayman islands..another fresh start","tags":["personal"],"date":"December 23, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/I-found-a-job-in-cayman-islands/"}}
