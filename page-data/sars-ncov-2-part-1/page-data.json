Beyond the similarity to this viruses, not enough data is available to trace the origins of this virus. Some say its an employee failed to follow best practice safety procedures allowing it to escape from one of the most sophisticated biolab in the world situated in Wuhan (the epicenter of the contraction) or rather passed on evolution of the virus from animals as some experts say its from civet cats or some say it came from bats. For now, that is not the main concern.</p>\n<p>The gripping nature of this problem caught my attention, an unfolding mayhem the world is unprepared with. The pandemic is at its early stages and a lot of reactions from governments, the busineess community and people all over the world are starting to unfold. Panic buying in a lot of medicines and medical equipment. Mass travel bans on hard hit places like China, Iran and South Korea is being implemented. China being the 2nd biggest economy is now shutting down its factories, under producing a lot of raw materials and products that is being exported in a lot of countries around the world. Stock markets are having record lows since 2008.</p>\n<p>There are the facts that everyone should know..</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is highly transmissible, even carriers in incubation period can transmit the virus.</li>\n<li>We clearly do not have enough medical infrastructure to accomodate 1.5 billion people that can become seriously affected. Respirators to help in breathing or even simple masks and protective equipments are not enough to combat this magnitude. That is why a lot of experts are recommending draconian measures to slow down the spread.</li>\n<li>Poorer countries will suffer a lot. As shown in Iran, significant portion of the infected people died because inadequate facilities and less skilled medical practioners.</li>\n<li>There is no cure yet. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/305bb86f7333deeae2dc6e470809a1a3/07caa/rats.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 97.89090909090909%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"rats\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/305bb86f7333deeae2dc6e470809a1a3/c739e/rats.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/305bb86f7333deeae2dc6e470809a1a3/8ee9c/rats.jpg 148w,\n/static/305bb86f7333deeae2dc6e470809a1a3/ebbe7/rats.jpg 295w,\n/static/305bb86f7333deeae2dc6e470809a1a3/c739e/rats.jpg 590w,\n/static/305bb86f7333deeae2dc6e470809a1a3/5413e/rats.jpg 885w,\n/static/305bb86f7333deeae2dc6e470809a1a3/4efde/rats.jpg 1180w,\n/static/305bb86f7333deeae2dc6e470809a1a3/07caa/rats.jpg 1375w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>It may take a year or even two years just to develop a vaccine. A lot of tests will be made with lab-rats until clinical testing to actual patients. </p>\n<p>Am I in fear of getting it… I should say yes for a bit and no largely. I have taken enough measures to stay healthy for the past year and this will make my immune system more resilient. Now my fear is for the world’s reaction when they hear so much horrifying stories related to this pandemic especially in poorer countries like sub-saharan africa. I also fear the supply chains failing to support our hyper connected and interdependent demands. This could trigger a snowball effect that can result to civil unrest and violence. For now this is what I’m constantly understanding. This first wave is still unfolding in 50 countries. </p>\n<p>It has not yet touched Cayman Islands. Or it has already and not yet reported. For now, I’m constantly monitoring the economic implications is an utmost priority.</p>","excerpt":"There is so much still that we do not know from the disease COVID-2019.
