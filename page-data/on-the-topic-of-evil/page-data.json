I guess the current state of the world is so erratic that it pulled me to this underlying meta-structures that transcended over history - like the role of evil that helped shaped our present time.</p>\n<p>Hitler was an artist. Hard to believe but he was once a painter that ventured to Vienna when he was younger. Unfortunately, he was categorized by the university he enrolled with as not artistic. It’s just mind shattering to reflect that its easier for him to orchestrate the nazis and eliminate the Jews (and almost destroying the world…) than sit down in room and paint in a canvas.</p>\n<p>Stalin is the worst monster during his time. Imagine that if you stop clapping during his speeches - you’re done, people will take you and you’ll be assasinated. The gulags he built tell the horrible tales of the application of marxist lies. He is so mad that he even killed his wife in the process of his delusions.</p>\n<p>Those living at the time are in constant hell - death and suffering almost a constant. Bloodshed all over the world. The very aspect of the past that we in the present tend to forget or even dare to try to even understand.</p>\n<p>Evil, in my understanding is a misrepresented concept. The way I see it now after my deep dive on this topic - I see it as the fight response that we honed two million years ago. This self defense mechanism kicks in to protect us, but when misaligned due to reasons like drugs, mental illnesses or even poor parenting or guidance - becomes a pathway for the psyche to inflict unecessary damage and suffering. </p>\n<p>Carl Jung’s description of the shadow captures well this topic. Deep inside us resides primal forces that was honed through time by our ancestors and if not integrated and developed  will cause damage to ourselves and the people around us. That is why for him, to reach our maximum abilities - integrating the strength of the shadow inside us through acceptance and control enables us to tap into its abilities in a productive manner, making us establish better decisions through our complete undestanding of ourselves.</p>","excerpt":"When the world where at the mercy of two devils..
