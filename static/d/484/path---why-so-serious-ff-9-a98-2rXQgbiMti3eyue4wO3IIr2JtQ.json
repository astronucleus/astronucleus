The title of this post is one of Joker’s famous lines..in one of my most favorite performances in a <a href=\"\">movie</a>. But the question have been a theme lately as I’m often ask of it a lot (or a variation of the same question). </p>\n<p>The answer/s are complicated. I wonder how long this post will going to be..</p>\n<p>Boredom and Focus. Realizing the value of mindfulness and stoicism in my life have taken me to a place to scrutinize my way of response to each information that my mind absorbs or creates. That’s a long sneaky sentence but pretty much captures my point. I find true value in focused effort to improve instead of wasting time to unproductive habits. Nowadays its just so easy to become bored, just hold your smartphone and you’ll never get bored - possibly forever. As I have said in one of my blog posts <em>small stuff matter</em>.</p>\n<p>Regret. This is an overlying theme to everything I do. I deeply regret wasting time. Time is the most precious resource, we trade it for attention, money etc.. I regret having lived a life that other people forced into me.. Regret is a powerful force that most do not think about - until they are in the worst situations or the lying in the deathbed.</p>\n<p>Truth. Being serious, focused and purposeful is living on the side of truth. If everyone would just read and understand what have happened in the past, I think there wouldn’t be a need to create this blog post. History as bloody as it may seem, teaches the truth - knowledge fortified over time.</p>\n<p>Health. Neuroscience explains a lot about how our body operates - each action powered by a single / group of hormones. There is incentive in doing things right and not half baked as these hormones reinforces what we do. Do a specific action numerous times and you have a habit. Do it a certain number years and it will a significant effect your health. </p>\n<p>Purpose. I believe that my purpose in this world is to make it better and impart the right values to the next generation. This requires tremendous effort, time and energy. This requires me to learn new skills. This requires me to seek refuge in a stable environment. This requires me to experiment. </p>\n<p>I could add more to this list, It is not that long as I thought it would but I pretty much added value in answering the question.. I hope people will start asking themselves of the same question. Why so serious? or rather why not?</p>","excerpt":"As a fan of the comics  Batman , the concept of having a clown as the main antagonist is so cool and crazy for avid followers like me.
