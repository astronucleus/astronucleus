Maybe I have explained a variant of this concept in one of my topics but here I will try to expand on it to describe what is happening on United states as of the moment.</p>\n<p>Imagine the idea of “defunding the police” as the alternative to the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Such decision will allow defenseless people exposed to violence and crime in the event that police departments are crippled. Moron crowds now are becoming louder to the point that absurd ideas are capturing their minds. </p>\n<p>Now it is becoming more evident that the effects of the abundance of internet noise have crippled the mind of many to even have the capability to think critically. From an evolutionary perspective, this can be such adaptation of our species to technology. We are the only animals who can cook, speak various languages, use tools that paved way to the modern worldw wher 50% of the population now can live in cities. The evolutionary influence of internet technology is so tiny as it is somewhat less than a decade of existence is so miniscule to our two hundred thousand years of existence as homo sapiens. But such information abundance is a threat to us all.</p>\n<p>Why is it a threat? I believe we are not able yet to adapt to such tremendous surge of information. Our brain has limitations on memory and energy. It had evoled for emphasizing social structures as a solution to the tremendous lack of strength and speed - as this were the go to skills for surving in the past. We are the first animals to have strong beliefs and perceptions that can unite nations and even billions of people through money, justice and religion. The ability to band through ideas and move forward into the future has brought us to this point where we can write code or communicate through whatsapp or messenger. Beyond this abilities, we are exposed to the natural world - especially our human nature. </p>\n<p>The craziness inside us can create pathological narratives like communism, marxism and postmodernism sound so acceptable. Read about maoist china. Read stories about the Gulag and Russian communism. Unable to parse infomation in the modern age makes you vulnerable to ideas or seemingly good idea sugar coated in a false narrative. The idea of defunding the police sound so feasible when watching the killing of Floyd. But if you are going to weigh on it, such single incident does not even justify such move to remove essential resources from the people who cause fear to criminals. The generalization of one event and paint a picture that every policemen are bad is so absurd. But the average person now is incapable of thinking clearly, simply just gravitate to accpeting a false narrative and when the moment of opportunity comes, joins a movement with false premises. We are seeing so much of this observations all over the world. </p>\n<p>The world is so confused. Again our evolutionary state is crippling the average person from shielding from tremendous noise. Unable to whitstand false narratives that cause them to harm the people and nature arround them. This is rather terrifying. As climate change is knocking ferrociously into our doorsteps through stronger weather disturbances - we might be in for a chaotic world in the next five to ten years. I do not see most people capable of creating their own understanding. As more people get gripped by tremedously bad ideas..all I can do perhaps is write about what worst events are going to unfold.</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"strangebets It took a lot of radical acceptance to how reality works in order to become immune to what is happening now in this generation…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/rational-stoic/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"The world getting confused..","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","rational-stoic"],"date":"June 26, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/confusion/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
