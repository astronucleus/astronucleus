Some of these problems have plagued us for the last couple of decades and shows evidence that we are not coping with the growing population and degredation of natural resources. As the under-educated population gets bigger and bigger, it then magnifies the problem leading to more loses in time, resources, opportunity and even lives. <!-- What I meant by under-educated Filipinos are the ones who decide to just complain about the situation and just follow the big three (this is why I don't watch the news at all). I believe a large number of the population has this mindset. --></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A message for the Philippine government, media, businesses and my fellow countrymen..</p>\n<p>History shows that the massive improvements we enjoyed in the last 1.8 million years as humans were <a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/19-great-inventions-that-revolutionized-history\">all attributable to technology</a>. Thinking big is a “mindset” that every nation should adopt. Innovation is a must if a nation will want a more favorable results as using outdated solutions to solve the same old problems will always have the same outcome.  </p>\n<p>I applaud our president Rodrigo Duterte and his administration for their accomplishments. But the magnitude of problems currently being handled by the government will not be solved with the current technologies that we apply. </p>\n<p>Traffic will not be solved by more roads and it can be solved by self-driving cars. Jobs can only be created through changing our curriculums to include computer coding and foreign languages as core subjects. We should use vertical farms to alleviate the problems of food shortages. Smart cities should be implemented instead of people living in high risk areas of flooding and soil erosion. This options are now available and being adopted to other countries. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So we got two options.. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adapt - As the world is rapidly evolving, I honestly believe that adapting is a must current trends. Take bold risks, investments and insights. There is a mars mission now and rockets return to earth automatically, virtually any problem can be solved. This is the hardest pursuit of any person or nation will ever do but this is the only way. History speaks for itself.</li>\n<li>Die - Yes, die slowly as a nation. Failing to accept the role of technology causes more problems because it adds up to the old problems. A nation that fails to adopt will lose it’s capacity to drive growth and serve itself.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what will you choose? adapt or die?</p>","excerpt":"Why does India have a space program and Filipinos does not even care about this question at all?
