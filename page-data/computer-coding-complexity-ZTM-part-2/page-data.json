The moment you cut one of the heads, two new heads will grow!</em></strong> </p>\n<p>I wish I have blogged more on the mundane experiences of starting to learn how to code, well here I am now as I try to expand and share how hard computer coding is. </p>\n<p>How hard is it really? besides that humans and computers communicate differently, the biggest challenge in creating code is the tons of problems that one will face over a lifetime of even a single project. Like the mythological creature above - finding a solutions to a certain problem will create new problems most fifty percent of the time. Like what I’m encountering now with my code base for modernizing the <a href=\"https://caymaneco.org\">caymaneco website</a>; after fixing homepage’s views to adapt to any device, I happen to find myself a few hours later scratching my head for an error in grabing the image from contentful due to keys and app ids. </p>\n<p>The hard part most of the time is this errors are mostly very hard to comprehend when you encounter it the first time. Like my case, I’m using the newly developed Gatsby Cloud which just got released November 2019. I could technically say that I’m one of the early adapters of the stack and will really be having a hard time scavenging answers in the interweb for help because mostlikely the errors that I will encounter will be new. Might need to deal with this mind bending truth in the coming weeks and hopefully I amase enough self-discipline and grit to finish the project. </p>\n<p>Patience is warranted in code - maybe more than intelligence. As all technologies are evolving as I write this blog, relying on grit and patience will keep me moving forward instead of relying on my technical competence especially that I ain’t that well versed with computer science concepts. Maybe to my luck I was bestowed by fate to have enough genes to have a will of stone to keep on going despite the abstract information that keeps on banging my eyes everytime I stare at my code.</p>\n<p>What works for that helps develop my grit for code is being deeply grateful that the oppurtunity to have unique problems in the world of machines is something to savor a lot. I have faced so many challenges in my life but try to learn how to talk to a server in another country is such a mindblowing experience in itself. I am just holding into the prediction that in the future this skill will allow me to land a job maybe in Canada or Europe. </p>","excerpt":"Computer coding is like trying to hold a sword infront of a hydra.
