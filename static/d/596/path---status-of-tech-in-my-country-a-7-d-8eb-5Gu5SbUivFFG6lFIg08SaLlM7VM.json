Technology is not a main agenda of these three. Thus, we are falling far behind in the area of innovation.</p>\n<p>As the world is rapidly evolving, I honestly believe that my home country is not being able to adapt to the current trends. Take a look at these problems..</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It is estimated that the country loses <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/970553/jica-traffic-congestion-now-costs-p3-5-billion-a-day-metro-manila-traffic-jica-cost-of-traffic\">3.5 billion pesos (66 million USD)</a> in traffic everyday. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Degredation of natural resources is already affecting human lives. <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/212703-how-itogon-benguet-naga-cebu-landslides-are-alike\">Soil erosion killed 90 people</a> and others missing in two separate locations in a span of a week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1108534.pdf\">2016 study</a> shows that as a country, we are producing students incapable of adopting to the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Food supply have been an issue in the recent months. <a href=\"https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2018/08/30/Philippine-rice-crisis-escalates-as-shortages-push-prices-to-a-three-year-high\">Rice shortage</a> is a three year high. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these problems have plagued us for the last decade and shows evidence that we are not coping with the growing population and degredation of natural resources. As the under-educated population gets bigger and bigger, it then magnifies the problem leading to more loses in time, resources, opportunity and even lives. What I meant by under-educated Filipinos are the ones who decide to just complain about the situation and just follow the big three (this is why I don’t watch the news at all). I believe a large number of the population has this mindset.</p>\n<p>History shows that the most improvements we had in the last 1.8 million years of existence were achieved in the past 400 years, all attributable to technology. I would like to think that technology is a “mindset”. Using old methods to solve the same old problems will always have the same outcome. Innovation is a must if one will want a more favorable result. </p>\n<p>I applaud the current government for its accomplishment in solving some of our problems but still I see that even the government is very slow to adapt new solutions being used in other countries. Sadly, the way for new laws to be implemented..it takes a lot of time. A large part of congress also have their self-interests are first prioritize instead of the nation. </p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html\">Google, Apple and other companies</a> have already declared that they don’t need a degree for certain professions to hire.</p>","excerpt":"Why does India have a space program and our country does not even care about this question at all?
