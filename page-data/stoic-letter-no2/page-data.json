We are becoming weaker in mind and the body suffers. We prioritize the mediocre and stable flow of life which we cannot sustain over generations. We fail to feed our primal body with activities that enrich our psyche. It becomes a cycle that expands over days then months then years, us not seeing that time has slipped and we are so obsessed with the inaction that we took in the past - not doing even longer walks or short runs. Not playing outside of our houses. Clutching more insane time with our devices or the fake reality that social media brings. We devote our time to the things that do not sustain our sound psyche in the long run. It becomes the fatal loop that will bring our society to its knees. This letter is for the weak, the obese and the confused. Do not think that fasting or eating alone can out run the reality that your body needs pain and activity to balance out the hormones that plague our daily lives. For you who is weak can become weaker over time. For you that think that the crowd or the flickering advertisements are the right guide - what you feed your body - food, ideas and exercise are fundamental for a healthy and more productive life. Nothing can replace each. Healthy ideas will bring a healthy mind, as it goes the same for food and especially exercise. </p>\n<hr>","excerpt":"When health of the mind and the body is the worst thing to discuss in the modern world… Why have we gonen insane in this century, forgetting…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/stoic-letters/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"A stoic letter, when most think taking care of our body and mind sounds insane..","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","stoic-letters"],"date":"October 18, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/stoic-letter-no2/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
