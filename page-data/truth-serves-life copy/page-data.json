It’s like a re-assessing my existence for the past five years - becoming now unsure if I really blossomed during my struggles, questioning if what I believe of myself now is a correct assessment of a profound persona as I claim to. I might be just recycling philosophical discussions in my head and spitting it out for the sake of boasting or improving my self righteousness. Why I am thinking like this after some days scavenging my deepest thoughts on the first few pages of the book?</p>\n<p>For Neitzsche “Truth should serve life..” and this concept of truth or what truth actually is have stricken my very notion of how I act out my beliefs. Despite my experiences that elevated my understanding than the average person could ever conceived - Neitzsche’s undertanding of how we should frame our ability to derive truth and its life preserving purpose is so beyond the reach of my capacity to think out of the box. This book clearly is the most important read so far in my journey through western thought and philosophy…</p>\n<p>As I read more of Neitzsche’s assertions…I’ll continue to write in this blog to enhance my capacity to extract the core values that Beyond Good and Evil can provide. I know that this will greatly increase the basic structures that I so continue to nurture - so far I’m enjoying the time I spend on this book..</p>","excerpt":"Beyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Neitzsche could become my favourite book of all time, I am stuck at pages 1 to 9 for days now and can’t…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Truth serves life","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art"],"date":"February 03, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/truth-serves-life copy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
