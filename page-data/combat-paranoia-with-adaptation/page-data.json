One must accept that the only way out of this situation the world is at the individual level is through our perception of how bad things can be. As of this writing, there are about 14,366 deaths and 321,943 confirmed cases (grossly understated due to lack of testing in 95% of countries) and these numbers will go exponentially in the next two weeks that there is no more comprehension available to what these numbers means as we are not wired to understand massive suffering. I believe that stoic writings and teachings have never been so much important in this time of unprecedented uncertainty. There is no way but the mind, conquering it day by day. What enters your brain greatly affects your actions and understanding of the world. I am currently fortifying my understanding of the chaotic nature of the situation by consuming the “right” content. Eg. I’m revisiting one of the most powerful books ever written “The obstacle is the way” by Ryan Holiday. I highly recommend this as a fuel for any wayward neurons one have. A nutritous feed of data in your brain is so vital now more than ever. Also adding an array of a more primitive selection of experiments to the mix is a win win situation as I get more better use of my time, energy and brain while creating tools and knowledge that will help me in the coming months. There is a better use of our finite time in this world, even in this kinds of situations. Forcing the brain to take all the best information it can suck in is the way forward.</li>\n<li><strong>Strengthen the body</strong>. OThe body is as important as the mind. Our autonomic response is kind of uncontrollable but is a key part of our brain especially in moments of chaos as our actions can go to the darkside once one is not trained to reflect a lot. I was able to prove this when training for pistol shooting in the local gun club. The body naturally tweaks at the moment the sound of the gunshot shreiks all over the body. Experienced shooters tell me its part of the process, that is why they try to train all the time to focus their aim and avert the negative effects of our body going autonomous. Our body is moving by itself all the time and is guided by various parts of our brain - closely related to the limbic part (AKA reptilian part).</br></br> Continued cycling and calisthenics are the measures I have taken before the virus have taken over and will still continue until the CI government prevents people from going out. Another very powerful measure I have taken lately was sleeping early. I bought a hammock and have been sleeping outside the backyard in the middle of two trees. I bet the natural sounds of insects and fresh air have made my environment more cozier for me to sleep much better. I still am tweaking it because all the sand flies are munching on me while doing this. </br></br>Meditation is very important now more than ever as this helps combat the uptick of stress which downgrades our immune response. 20-minutes a day of breathing exercise regulates our stress levels to its lowest, allowing our natural defense mechanism to function as intended. Allowing new active skills like playing the guitar, sketching and writing this blogs helps in lowering stress too.</li>\n<li><strong>Strengthen the diet</strong>. The ketogenic diet has never been more important at this point for everyone. Sugar overly disregulates our energy levels and are being cited as a probable uptick trigger in people that had been diagnosed with the virus. The primal way of eating enhances our chances of using our immune system at its max capacity - especially if you throw intermittent fasting and autophagy into the mix. After a year on keto, I am made to believe that our ability to think clearly is largely associated in how we manage our energy through the food we eat and optimization of our autonomous muscle and brain systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For now, I believe improving one’s mind, body and diet is very necessary. Thinking big and critical is so powerful now, as downplaying the coronavirus pandemic will most likely cost human lives. </p>","excerpt":"We are fucking adaptation machines and this has been the case for the last 200,000 years..
