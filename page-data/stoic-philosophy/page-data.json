But what I was able to do with stoicism is the main focus of this blog post.</p>\n<p>Stoicism. I first encountered this frame of thinking from Tim Ferris, author of Tools for titans and 4HWWK and he explains it as his main operating system for life. It is a life altering mindset, much better than anything I’ve come across - believe me I’ve studied and tried everything. </p>\n<p>Ms. Alpha (my boss here in the islands) recently have a piece of comment on my look while walking towards her wearing my full packed bicycle gear all with a camera on my helmet. “Miguel is like a machine, he got everything right - he has his diet and his exercise”. I hope I remembered everything that she said correctly but what my response to her is that “This island is like magic island, the island allows me to do practially everything I want”. </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/fd8b6ddbb28104b4c2343e4e7c8e8307/64e16/machine.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 85.13513513513513%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"machine\"\n        title=\"machine\"\n        src=\"/static/fd8b6ddbb28104b4c2343e4e7c8e8307/1c72d/machine.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fd8b6ddbb28104b4c2343e4e7c8e8307/a80bd/machine.jpg 148w,\n/static/fd8b6ddbb28104b4c2343e4e7c8e8307/1c91a/machine.jpg 295w,\n/static/fd8b6ddbb28104b4c2343e4e7c8e8307/1c72d/machine.jpg 590w,\n/static/fd8b6ddbb28104b4c2343e4e7c8e8307/a8a14/machine.jpg 885w,\n/static/fd8b6ddbb28104b4c2343e4e7c8e8307/64e16/machine.jpg 948w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Why she called me a machine? I cycle a minimum of 14 kms a day, eating only meat and fats (keto!!) while trying to maintain a high octane kind of work in the ground floor of our company. I am just happy that she appreciated the way I try to do life - as I see most are just baffled or confused of what I do. She and her husband Mr. Elie (my boss as well) understands my views that is why I try to reciprocate the appreciation with the highest quality of work possible. I love their knowledge of philosohy and history and it makes it easier for us to talk most of the time. </p>\n<p>But that is not a complete answer as after reflecting much on what she said.  Why I do what I do is because predicated on the idea that I don’t like regrets - health, learning and life is most real when your moving and experiencing.. stoicism is my pillar for this thougths. </p>\n<p>Stoicism fits with physics, natural selection, psychology, calming oneself and the drive to master skills. The ability to watch people interacting with you even in a contentious one - stoicism makes it easy to understand anything. It’s just so weird that this way of thinking is so ancient as the greeks and it works all the time. </p>\n<p>When you were put into experiences where you lose everything - literally - friends, money and resources - this pushes one to make a complete reformation of life. I’m really happy that I have read on stoicism as it kept the last breathing piece of me to be intact enough to get things together and resurge with flames of freedom like a phoenix. </p>\n<p>Rebirth. I’m a changed person after I crashed and burned in my project in Palawan. But that gave me the most powerful realization of all - Invincibility is achieved in the mind, not through material things or the retinas of others…Invincibility is truly achieved in stoicism.</p>","excerpt":"For the complete history of stoicism - I made a separate website for it.
