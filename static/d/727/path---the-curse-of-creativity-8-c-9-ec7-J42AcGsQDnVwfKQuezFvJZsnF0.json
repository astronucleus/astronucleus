Dr. Jordan Peterson coined a this as a curse, the curse of creativity. He explains that it is one of the worst talents that you can have. It is very difficult to create an identity for yourself as your constant fascination constantly drag you to different directions. Another thing is creativity is very very difficult to monetize and make as a career..</p>\n<p>His explanation was my a narrative that played for the past two years. I sure did enjoy doing the following jobs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>vlogger </li>\n<li>blogger</li>\n<li>social media marketer </li>\n<li>web developer</li>\n<li>blockchain developer</li>\n<li>marketing and business development head</li>\n<li>drone operator</li>\n<li>construction supervisor</li>\n<li>video editor  </li>\n<li>accountant </li>\n<li>tour guide  </li>\n<li>historian</li>\n<li>camp volunteer</li>\n<li>finance manager</li>\n<li>entrepreneur</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the eyes of many, they couldn’t understand what I was doing. For me, I was only doing what I think was really good to try.. </p>\n<p>I simply tried doing the fun stuff. There were a lot of good and bad in it. </p>\n<p><em>I lost a ton of money. I gained a lot of experience. I ignored great advices, but learned thereafter..</em></p>\n<p>The process was excruciatingly risky and comfortable. I did helped a ton of people, something I can be really proud of.</p>","excerpt":"This blog post have puzzled me for months, probably have made a different version of some type of it in the past..
