I feel the need for meaning is part of us and have realized that so much are in need of structures that can support the suffering of life. It is more important than ever that I share how my personal learning and experiences shaped me and be able to become somewhat stronger than the average person and move a step ahead than most on their decisions. This are fundamental reasons why I am going to build my ideas on <a href=\"https://rationalstoic.com\">Rational Stoic</a>.</p>\n<p>This is a big challenge for me. I battle my weaknesses like poor in creating grammatically sound ideas and had never created an actual educational course except when I made seminars in my stint as a warehouse manager in the Philippines. Nevertheless, the project is too important to not to do.</p>\n<p>I’ll be using <a href=\"https://tech-stoic.github.io\">Tech-Stoic</a> as a place where I upload and reread my draft tomes for <a href=\"https://rationalstoic.com\">Rational Stoic</a> starting today. I found after deciding that I will alotting three weeks to the lessons for <a href=\"https://www.rationalstoic.com/works/intro-to-darwinian-theory\">Darwinian Theory</a>, I only was able to make some art but unable to write the drafts. I guess I also need to remind myself everyday to create or edit atleast one draft every single day from now on - which is a bit of a toll in my loaded daily habit schedule. But I think such measure is necessary to create some kind of push for myself and do not lose the knowledge, continously improve the cohesion of the topics that energize the value that Rational Stoic can create in the long run. </p>\n<p>I want to thank <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/emilia.runarsdottir?ref=content_filter\">Emilia Runarsdottir</a> for creating my logo a looong time ago.^_^</p>","excerpt":"Diluting all essential truths that I have acquired (and continously acquiring) so far and sharing it to the world in need of direction and…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/rational-stoic/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rational Stoic","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","rational-stoic"],"date":"May 31, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/rational-stoic/"}}}
