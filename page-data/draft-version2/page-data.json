This version might prove to be a better layout of the problem as starting to frame the problems of the mind in the modern context and how it relates to us not being able to stand together and fix the existential threats looming in the background. Let’s try to write it…</p>\n<p>Part 1: What stops us from becoming beacons of altruism?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our biological features (Human evolution, diet and suboptimal use of our body and mind)</li>\n<li>Our Social upbringing (Where you were born, parenting and society)</li>\n<li>Ideologies (Carl Jung, Neitszche, Mythology)</li>\n<li>Not adapted to technology (Social Media, Human Evolution part 2, Neuroscience)</li>\n<li>Summary: A meaningless society equates to poor stewards of the natural world</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part 2: Why do we need to become beacons of altruism?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Solve existential threats</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Climate Disruption</li>\n<li>Wars</li>\n<li>Technological Disruption</li>\n<li>Managenent of natural resources (pollution, population)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Extend life beyond Earth</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part 3: Can we do it?\n* Yes\n* No\n* ?????? </p>\n<p>I still have to ponder on this structure but it kind of hits the frame on how I want to explain this process.</p>\n<p>I might still change my layout though as I fill in the ideas of this book. </p>\n<p>PS. I might code another website for drafting the book. Yeah, why not?</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"Rethinking the bigger picture or message of the problem I am trying to understand… I saw some flaws today into how I am trying to break the…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/the-next-aion/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Outline Ver. 2","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","the-next-aion"],"date":"July 20, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/draft-version2/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
