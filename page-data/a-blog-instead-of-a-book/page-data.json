I could only see two compelling reason:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Organizing myself while the effects of a pandemic and economic crash is something out of this world and very crazy to navigate with the tools bestowed to us. It takes a paradigm shift to make sound decisions nowadays or even just avoid stupidity and pathological ideas. Clearly, the time we are in now is something our parents have not encountered even. It is really hard way to get great advice nowadays especially as most people are kindoff disconnected with nature and history.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My accounting job here in the Cayman Islands needs some particular attention. I haven’t convinced myself that we are going back to normal so staying focused on generating great opportunities for the company I’m working in is a focus that I try to make sure I have. It is becoming a variation of two choices for people reacting to the pandemic - either they become hedonistic or they become grateful … I do not know the exact averages of the number of people in each group of thinking but definitely the magnifying effect of stress in a pandemic have tilted most to each ideology. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am still trying to sort out my ideas on what I’m going to do for the next year or so. Migrating to Canada or New Zealand? or staying here in Cayman Islands and settle here, I really do not know the solution to my problem as of the moment as Geopolitics, the pandemic, being a non-westerner, economic fallout and climate change / disturbances is clearly knocking to this single problem of moving forward into the future.</p>\n<p>I could pick the solution of the “future” problem into a sizeable answer: “the most sound goal is to make sure that I get a western status…” despite the significant effects of disruptive nature of the coronavirus pandemic in western policies. Kid me not, the work I do currently in the collections and accounting of our company is working well for me but still it doesn’t add up to the potential of me imparting a better future for the family I’m looking to build. Looking too much at the present set-up is too dumb in my opinion especially if avoiding risk is more emphasized as a strategy - clearly, this is not my in agreement in my core philosophy.</p>","excerpt":"Rethinking the book project? or my process on dealing with the project itself?
