I love capitalism. It allows me to enjoy the benefits of a society that was built by talent, education and progress. Never in our lifetime have existed 7.7 billion people that can enjoy the resources of this planet and use it to improve all of our living standards without the threat of war. It is truly amazing to live in this moment. Even a guy like me can learn about anything, use rectangular boxes called computers to code and communicate a information through a website and publish it through servers and making it accessible through smart devices within a few clicks. </p>\n<p>But I have fears that capitalism is the way forward. Though the thought that all of our societies best benefits is built on this concept, I see its flaws now revealing itself. </p>\n<p>Information on this is truly scary but enlightening.</p>\n<p>I have seen capitalism in Africa and my firsthand experience with it is not my best performance as a human being. I’m not proud of helping a governmnent official steal oil from its country’s resources and transfer it to his personal business. Capitalism became a way wherein corruption got out of hand. I would not specifically name who is the people involved to promote safety of others still working with them.</p>\n<p>Capitalism enabled tax evasion by transfering wealth in various tax havens all around the world. This money could have been used to improve third world economies but instead pooled out of their countries.</p>\n<p>Capitalism also have introduced social media wherein everyone created a web of information that seems to be reality. Most people get their knowledge from Facebook, Twitter &#x26; Instagram  and what is scary is that data in these platforms are largely unverified.</p>\n<p>Capitalism also hides the layers of history. It is so easy to believe for the younger generations that the world is a static ball of happiness and abundance. The age of our specie is around 250,000 years and the age of stability that we currently have is just 50 years!!!</p>\n<p>Lastly, capitalism paved way for this particular incident wherein Exxon Mobil executives hid the <a href=\"\">devastating effects of fossil fuel use</a> and thus increasing human caused global warming and climate changes. The effects of one single memo produced by the executives of this company is so catasthropic that it will change the path of history forever.</p>\n<p>I overused the word capitalism here because I’m trying to paint a picture that this is so far the best that our society have produced to harness our human capabilities and solve our daily struggles - but its not even perfect at all. Civilization is continously transforming itself and we might be in a time that we need to improve. </p>","excerpt":"Don’t get me wrong. I love capitalism.
