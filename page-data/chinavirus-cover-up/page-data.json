On January 3, 2020 a police unit went to admonish his statement and make him sign a document that he is making fake news. This event if taken very seriously by the chinese government could have prevented the trillions of dollars lost from economies, loss of jobs and the unimaginable suffering and deaths still unfolding.</p>\n<p>But why did the chinese government hid the information? why did the local officials do such a short sighted move to not think about the possible effects their actions? These are really hard questions to answer but I have a bit of understanding on how the flow of thinking pattern that eventually have created such actions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"xijinping.jpg\" alt=\"xijinping\"></p>\n<p>Known to all of us is that the chinese government is implementing a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China\">communism</a> for governing China and its international projects. Resources are allocated through the concept of common ownership, allowing the means and results of production be shared equally. Seems very beneficial right? everybody gets to be treated equally, everybody gets equal amount of resources even if you are poor.</p>\n<p>If you will not think critically, it doesn’t seem to be completely bad to structure the future of a population or a country over equality of outcome. But there underlies a fundamental problem - the amount of lying needed to push this form of governance is so tremendous that blood is needed to be spilled numerous times and has proved fatal for 200 Million deaths from Lenin, Pol Pot and Mao’s separate regimes unfolding in the last 100 years. Not rewarding people for their ability to produce and rewarding the non-producers is utterly bad. Like what happened with Dr. Li. He produced vital information for the world and yet he was penalized for doing so. The ability of the chinese government to determine what is true in the province of Hubei was so impaired that it triggered a pandemic and economic shutdown of the entire world. This is why communism will never work. No matter how much insidous state leaders will try - communism will never ever work.</p>\n<p>As we are still in the beginning of this massive re-organization through the coronavirus, I bet this means that even if the whole world knows that communism is utterly bad - we are not capable of fully erradicating it. I guess only time will tell if this event might help convice us all. Does it need another hundreds of millions of lives just for the entire world to learn that telling the truth is always the right way forward? </p>","excerpt":"Let me be clear, it is not the chinese people that has to deal with so much damage in this pandemic, President Xi and his Communist Party…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/coronavirus/","/tags/history/","/tags/creating-art/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"China crossing the line","tags":["blog","coronavirus","history","creating-art"],"date":"March 26, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/chinavirus-cover-up/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
