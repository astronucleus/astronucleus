I hope thanking you in this writing can lessen your suffering - such aim you continue to do for us who are constantly trying to contend with life’s struggles.</p>\n<p>I have been saved by you in ways unimaginable. I literally lost almost everything - some friends, a business, family members and resources - money and influence. It was a hell on its own and the crazy part is I am not a westerner, a Filipino in the middle of a town near Manila where lack of opportunity resides for the fallen. It is a hell of a start that needs also fixing devils that emerged from poorly assessed decisions tied with monetary and social implications. If not for your lectures that dominated my awakening - I won’t be at this stage that only few things in life can literally break me. </p>\n<p>You taught me how to not get confused and seek inwardly and how to select the few people that I should listen with.. This is where I started and yes I managed to become stronger and continously doing so..</p>\n<p>You taught me to become responsible as this is the precondition of a great society.</p>\n<p>You taught me to become competent, a hero in numerous forms capable of turning rubbish problems into gold.</p>\n<p>You taught me to seek true understanding and harness my insane curiosity, protect myself from the malevolence and suffering that is a constant of our human experience.</p>\n<p>You taught me to value people that wishes the best in me.</p>\n<p>You taught me to seek meaning instead of pleasure, meaning that creates the by-product known as happiness.</p>\n<p>You taught me to incorporate the part of me that is evil, so I can control it when necessary. You made me the most virtous version of myself that is stronger and far better.</p>\n<p>You taught me the archetypical layers of reality, an evolutionary structure where our species develop an advantage and became self-aware.</p>\n<p>You taught me the power of the biblical narration, transcending our world through the best conceptualization of a stable society. </p>\n<p>You taught me the value of creativity and how it can speak more than the knowledge we currently have.</p>\n<p>You taught me the bare minimums - seek work, preserve strong ties with family and friends, seek an intimate relationship, seek health and spiritual wellness, cultivate creativity…these things are hard but very pivotal for framing my foothold on how to tackle reality.</p>\n<!-- You gave me a structure on how to find someone that I can truly share my life with, I found her and I owe it all to you.\n -->\n<p><strong>I will always be in your debt, I owe to you this reality I’m touching now and continously making better..Thank you so much Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, I hope you get well soon..</strong></p>","excerpt":"Hope this reaches your notice Dr. Jordan B.
