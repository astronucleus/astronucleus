People got confused as the pragmatic nature of the problem caused by the coronavirus have caused displacement for the large part of the city and panic to people who has less resources (could easily be 60% of the city, considering most have spent their savings in the yearend holidays). These had decreased the ability of the government to manage the situation. But there is a bigger issue at hand.</p>\n<p>We only have in the country 400 respirators. Yes, for a country of 105 million, we have only 400. What this means is almost all of the people who can contract a severe version of the virus specifically around 5 million and most will be unable to get medical attention (this I believe is a low estimate thinking that lower than 20% of half of the population gets infected. Many will die. I can’t fucking believe I’m writing this words in my blog. Our country will go back to becoming a slave to a stronger nation state, after the dust settles or deteriorate in mass paranoia and instability.</p>\n<p>I have no choice but to write my thoughts. I have genuinely observed this situation since January and saw how it destroyed many lives. The coronavirus is not an existential threat to the human kind but the chaos it can bring can knockdown every strong nation to its knees and weaker nations like the ours to its demise. I bloody can’t believe what I see far into the near future of weeks and months to come. I hope I’m wrong. I really hope I’m wrong. Please wake me up from this bad dream.</p>","excerpt":"I never thought I’ll write something like this in my lifetime…   There is so much paranoia in people’s actions and decisions that is making…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/coronavirus/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Paranoia","tags":["blog","creating-art","coronavirus"],"date":"March 16, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/paranoia/"}}}
