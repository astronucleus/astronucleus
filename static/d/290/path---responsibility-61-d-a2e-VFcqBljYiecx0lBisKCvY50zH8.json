I am Miguel. A certified public accountant who have traveled parts of the world in search of meaning of life after my stint working in Dubai. The best answer that I was able to come up to-date was the “Divine Individual” theorized by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson (I have two <a href=\"https://tech-stoic.github.io/dr-jordan-b-peterson-part-2/\">blogs</a> for this guy). </p>\n<p>At an early age, I somewhat accepted that people’s journeys are very different. There is no one size fits all. The problem with my way of thinking at the time or even as an adult is I do things without proper philosphical foundation for my decisions. I tend to do things in a haphazard way…</p>\n<p>I have been responsible enough for my actions for most of my adult life. I’ve been into relationships with women that I thought that I would marry but ended up not getting to and I took responsibility for everything (predominantly at most are bad) that I can absorb. I have been entangled in entrepreneurial pursuits and manage all sorts of deals along with it. I have been truthful in every single word that I say to the people I worked with and it reciprocated with the authentic responses from people - business partners, workers, creditors, potential investors. Living with words truthfully lets one navigate the good, the bad and the ugly. I took the responsibility of being the head of the family for my mom and my brother after my dad left our family years ago. He’s back with us now but I am still operating my life as the person responsible for putting the food on the plate for the long-term basis.</p>\n<p>The Divine Individual as described by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson is grounded on individual responsibility. By what that means don’t be a victim, pick yourself up and go set face your own suffering. He further explains that a society filled with responsible people is the strongest, strong enough to cast a shield against the horrors of our past. His obsession to debunking the Nazi and Gulag evil got him to this point that to control mass amounts of people, the power must reside with each person and it shouldn’t reside in a single or few number of individuals.</p>\n<p>He further grounds responsibility as acting it out while keeping in mind that life is a series of games that we have to play. Step by step, each small action we take moves us a little bit upward, and a little bit more, repeating it again and again. He is famously noted for his analogy of cleaning up your room, that starting with the smallest part of your life that you can fix is the one that you start solving which most of the case is the environment around us, may it be our room or office desk or relationships. </p>\n<p>The divine individual is grounded as well on the idea that all human life has intrinsic value. This in effect my next task - transcend this message in the smallest possible chunk that I can start with. I think that will start with my personal relationships - my future wife and work relationships. I am taking little steps, as little as possible.</p>\n<p>But first I got to find her first..big task I believe. I’m expecting my OEC today that will finalize my tickets to Cayman Islands. I just really hope that she is there in KY.:-)</p>","excerpt":"Hi! I am Miguel.
