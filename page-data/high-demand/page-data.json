Being a big fan of the NBA and hearing praise from a lot of athletes and coaches - he is really worth checking out. His <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEHJHK/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0\">book</a> on leadership gave me a great insight on how to create success itself. His definition of success resonates to me even more after my path to enriching life experiences through fortification of habits are highly emphasized in his methodologies - like how he had tons of notebooks for his notes on practice routines, detailed minute by minute, literally insane at a time where the technology is limited.</p>\n<p>I’m chanelling on how he built a structure of methods on how he achieved a rare feat for his 10 year NCCA championship appearances (which he won 9 of them!) as I am trying to reflect on a voice of demand that I was like scratching for the past month I believe. What was this voice?</p>\n<p>I was in a conversation with my housemate about a consulting project that might be much needed in this crisis. I have a hunch that tremendous number of people is in need of help to reason out their way out of the uncertainty that is enveloping their situations. This idea got validated during my volunteering for the Cayman Islands Government to help the the travel assistance hotline. Tremendous number of people are starting again due to loss of jobs. Tons of economic damage is being endured and suffered by a lot and if I can help a bit to solve this problem, that would be a great feat.</p>\n<p>Fast track to now… since I can build a working software for such problem and offer how I’m managing the situation, I should be able to make a bridge project and help people. The things in my head as of the moment to create this project:\nNavotac?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A webpage explaining the project and how I can help</li>\n<li>A Google form to capture data from users of the service</li>\n<li>purchase of a domain site?</li>\n<li>a pdf outline of the step-by-step process</li>\n<li>link to projects?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still a rough list of things to do or think about. Still scratching my head over this.</p>\n<p>This is still being debated in my head but the degree of need about to solve the pain, anxiety and stress that this pandemic have caused many is really pushing me to share my story and how I can reach out to help people that are in need of help.</p>\n<p>I want to remember this pandemic as I stood in the side where I shared my best abilities in problem solving to reduce the suffering that is engulfing our world right at this moment..</p>","excerpt":"Success is peace of mind that is the direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best that you are capable…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Responding to high demand","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art"],"date":"May 02, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/high-demand/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
