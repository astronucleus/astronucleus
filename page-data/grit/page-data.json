I got hooked to basketball because of him as the sport is considered a religion in my country the Philippines. Always there is a basketball court in beside every church in every town across all islands.. - partly its because of politicians investing in this projects but I believe its more on the love of this american sport where we ought to have incorporated in our lives in recent times.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/83c9b1d9d0743faae54c536f9a36f8e0/f54d9/kobe.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 134.6749226006192%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"kobe\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/83c9b1d9d0743faae54c536f9a36f8e0/c739e/kobe.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/83c9b1d9d0743faae54c536f9a36f8e0/8ee9c/kobe.jpg 148w,\n/static/83c9b1d9d0743faae54c536f9a36f8e0/ebbe7/kobe.jpg 295w,\n/static/83c9b1d9d0743faae54c536f9a36f8e0/c739e/kobe.jpg 590w,\n/static/83c9b1d9d0743faae54c536f9a36f8e0/5413e/kobe.jpg 885w,\n/static/83c9b1d9d0743faae54c536f9a36f8e0/f54d9/kobe.jpg 969w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Enter MJ’s biggest fan - Kobe Bryant. He was a kid when MJ is at his prime, yet he was able get enough confidence to try and compete at his level. He studied real hard how he moves as seen in this <a href=\"\">video</a>. Though he was not able to achieve some of MJ’s accomplishments, Kobe on his own became a legend in his 20 years as a Laker.</p>\n<p>Kobe is the best example of how grit can transform a young kid that can compete with the greats, making small people look giants in the face of adversity. I kind of have a bit of grit in me but its more on a different base layer I guess, leaning on persevering on the hard stuff because I’m overly grateful of being alive and able to think, sketch, write and code my ideas for the world to read.</p>\n<p>Just like the problem that I have encountered earlier, coding websites have tons of nuisances and abstractions along the way that I’m trying to navigate. It is becoming more frequent to be honest especially that my volunteering project to upgrade the <a href=\"https://caymaneco.org\">Cayman Eco website</a> requires a ton of new technological integration - gatsby, graphql, github to name a few which are all newly created open source projects which relates to less available resource materials and  configurations may have tons of bugs - of which I encountered last week and now as I write for this separate code base. I forced myself to write something important and dense today, kind of out of routine for the past two weeks since I’m experimenting on new stuff - trying to incorporate “video games” again because of its potential to help my cognitive capacity. 15 KM weekends cycling is another energy drainer on Sundays yet I have increased my leg power in the process due to the uphill climb that I do in Camana Bay. The average person will define my ideas insane. I define it myself as stoic controllable actions - Grit fits the bill.</p>\n<p>Grit is something I am constantly trying to improve - spreading it in a lot of my habits, making the fortitude muscle in my brain fire and connect more neurons that will fight any kind of barrier or absurdity that I may end up facing. The mental muscle is worth reinforcing - especially nowadays that most get lost in the hyperconnected social media storms, brains getting eaten by instant notifications and impossible to achieve social norms. Developing one’s grit is highly recommended.</p>","excerpt":"As I was trying to create this blog, I happened to update the Gatsby-Cli (an NPM package used to develop this static websites..) and find…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/psychology/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Grit","tags":["blog","creating-art","psychology"],"date":"February 03, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/grit/"}}}
