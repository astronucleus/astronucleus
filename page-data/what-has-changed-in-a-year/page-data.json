Sleek in form and rarely fogged and can think critically the moment I wake up in the morning up to working intensively as an accountant and even up to my free time working creatively, my energy level is almost on the same level. I feel the fatigue at around 10pm, a sign that I should have slept already at 9pm. But that ketogenic diet plus cycling and meditating everyday have created a powerful mesh layer for my energy level to stay constant over 12 to 16 hours lengths on the average.</li>\n<li><strong>On cognitive capacity..</strong> I can play some notes on the guitar, pluck and do rythms. I can code websites. I can do simple caricatures. I can write a bit. I can on point talk expansively and rarely gets confused. Taking time to listen a lot of psychology materials from great thinkers (JBP, Neitszche, Carl Jung) help me frame better argument which also develop great layers of base theories on how I approach learning or acquiring skills in general.</li>\n<li><strong>On opportunity to impact society.</strong> This is still a big gray area but overall I could say I am still on track. My personal goal to become competent enough to foster a family in the coming years have never been more crystalized. I have an opportunity to donate to a school in Malaysia and created websites that can help spread better knowledge into the interweb. I am getting there as long as I take care of my health, learn whenever I can and build better relationships. Work in progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The pandemic has caused unfathomable challenges for most of the world and for us here in Cayman Islands where we are not required to wear masks anymore is in itself a big opportunity to write, code and build stuff that can  make the future way better. I am so lucky to be able to sit here in this island and be able to focus on evaluating myself instead of worrying even putting food into my mom’s plate. Hopefully my luck continues.</p>","excerpt":"Looking back on how much has my stay in Cayman Islands improved me… On overall health.  I feel really younger, stronger.
