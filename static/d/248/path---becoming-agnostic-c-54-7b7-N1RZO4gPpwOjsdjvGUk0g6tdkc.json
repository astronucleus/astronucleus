But is it really the right framing of ideas? Should we just move ahead and navigate life without a firm grounding of the past?</p>\n<p>Born to a poor family in San Ildefonso (a town 2 hours from Manila), I grew up serving the local catholic church as an altar boy and even got medals for it while studying. All of my friends did the same. My whole family practice christianity too. Serving the evening saturday mass felt like I was one of the cool kids helping spread the word of God.</p>\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRw9KkDZPkPHMq65GtSnPPnu1jIBSkVVo8xx6o9z78xAx1Z4wH5\" alt=\"christianity\" style=\"width: 700px\">\n<p>During my board examinations for praticing public and private accounting, I reconnected with my inner desire to connect with the creator. Most of our instructors explain the role of “God handling the things that we can’t control” during the seven months of review and tests. Things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worst room airconditioning. It takes 3 excruciating hours for each exam at the time. Room selection is random and based on your last name and selected schools by the Board of Accountancy. </li>\n<li>Eating spoiled food causing bad stomach. Some fix this problem by bringing packed lunch.</li>\n<li>Forgetting to bring important stuff like your exam passes or IDs. With the millions of topics covered in the exams, it is easy to neglect things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arriving late stops you from entering the examination rooms. Stress. Traffic. A lot of reasons. You get the picture.</p>\n<p>Early in my 20s, I was working as a cost accountant (eventually got promoted to lead the warehousing department) in a real estate company ran by a christian family. As an officer in the company, I hold myself obliged to support bible studies, friday morning gatherings, and some weekend mass/events. </p>\n<p>In a country where Islam and Christianity have existed for the most of history, you don’t have a choice but acknowledge the role of a creator the moment you are born.\nAnywhere you go, until you cease to exist..there you will bump into religious influence as I am describing in my personal stories. </p>\n<p>I wondered much on my inability to create software projects after learning computer coding and climate science back in October. Seeking to be more productive in improving my “original thinking” I found myself focusing on scientific beliefs like astronomy and philosophy. This then snow-balled to a series of crash course on biology, economics, media literacy, history and more. </p>\n<p>Religious belief has been the topic of debate from the era of greek philosophy and until at present times. Why can’t one acknowledge too many Gods? Why does the holy books did not mention the germ theory that could have saved a billion people? Why does the these books never mention nuclear technology? Why does the bible </p>\n<p>One thing is clear to me, there is a number of questions that the bible can answer but it cannot answer everything. Christianity have a helped the erradication of slavery all around the world but Science have a better grasp on what is happening around us like climate science, sustainability, artificial intelligence and tribalism. Staying ill-informed is not exercising our human ability to navigate the world around us. </p>\n<p>If I were to have a hand in my fate as to where I should started this life of sacrifice and struggle I wouldn’t choose a developing country hampered by ideologies like religion and corruption that don’t have any truthful basis. Unfortunately we don’t get that chance. <em>Gary Vaynerchuck’s quote for the odds of being a human is 400 trillion to one.</em> The mere fact that we are alive and have a chance to make a difference is all that matters. I hope you find my personal take on the role of religion to our civilization and current state insightful. </p>","excerpt":"We don’t choose our parents and most people would not reflect on that because there is no incentive in it - there is just no benefit on…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/personal/","/tags/darwinian-model/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Becoming Agnostic","tags":["personal","darwinian model"],"date":"February 05, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Becoming-Agnostic/"}}
