This happens in just less than a second. </p>\n<p>The only explanation that I can explore now is my adamant approach to making my brain develop properly - like how our ancestors did it. Maintaining an excellent ketogenic diet, exercising and sleeping well are foundational. tut more importantly, allowing The brain stem or more famously known as the lizard brain is the oldest part of our brain. Motor control and flight or fight response is governed by this part. We can’t control the growth of the brain stem directly but through habitual repetition - we can tap to its ability to record information that can flow as a faster response when shit hits the fan situation occurs.</p>\n<p>Most of our ancestors used the lizard brain in their daily lives that require tremendous quickness in response. Us in the modern world now is incapable of harnessing its help unless we intentionally develop it. Exercising and mindfulness practices I believe have been helping me develop this ancient data store. Neurons in our muscles are recording tiny bits of information that is derived everytime we engage in continous practice of mobility and acceptance of body pain. The intertwine that our subconcious mind can become calmer through meditation helps a lot in making subtle adjustments to optimize my responses. </p>\n<p>There is so much still untapped in my cognitive ability yet tapping into some of the lizard brain’s my bicycle failures gives me enough evidence that most of what I’m learning and applying to improve myself are working to my favor. Each intentional and unintentional errors keeps me awake and listening more to my self talk and effects to the body. Hope to write more about this topics in the future!</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/cad07/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100.13888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/c739e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/8ee9c/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 148w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/ebbe7/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 295w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/c739e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 590w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/cad07/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 720w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","excerpt":"I fell down from the bicycle, like a creepy crawling lizard today but what fascinated me was it did not kicked me in a heightened response…I…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/rational-stoic/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Lizard brain","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","rational-stoic"],"date":"July 02, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/lizard-brain/"}}}
