I’m terrified that our attempt to use the science as a frame for solving all our problems will ultimately fail and millions will literally suffer and die. These are stark ideas that I am so uncertain that I needed to write everything I am capable of understanding and the ones I cannot…</p>\n<p>But why I am the right person to write about these looming danger or even attempting the feat of a prophet or messiah. I am an ordinary accountant from the third world. I did not originate from a wealthy family nor got lucky in the genetic lottery. All I know that is unique about me is I have a deep passion to understand my curiosity and wherever it leads me. </p>\n<p>My curiosity have cracked a hole into absurdity that I stand with the few who can understand multiple sets of contradicting perspectives, may it be in biology, programming, business, economics, neuroscience, philosophy…what I’m trying to say is I’m highly open minded to any kind of problem solving methods. But the sad part of this gift (or burden) is I somehow see far into the future and all I can see are the problems. We are losing the grip to what maded the past 70 years the best period in human history. </p>\n<p>The multi-variant problem of a degenerating society is now at our grasp. We lack the societal design to solve what is often times in front of us. As a society to develop modern methods and technologies that solve the plastic pollution or climate change, our minds are preoccupied with so many tiny decisions that drives us to ignore the lurking doom in the next decade. </p>\n<p>I deal with this self talk everyday. Even though I’m okay, living as part of the richest group of people that ever walked the face of the planet as judge by historical standards, what demons that will come out from our past decisions keeps me thinking almost all the time. </p>\n<p>I fear for myself but I fear more for people whom have invested their whole life to mediocrity. A poor recognition of meta and phyisical reality can greatly affect one’s fate. Tremendous luck is necessary to move into the future. I really fear that many will die and suffer the consequences of the past decisions of many and our molding of the inner psyche. The aion of the aquarius mixes the fishes that swim between and beyond, yet we are rather unfortunate to be in its first path. The world will drown to what I am about to layout in the succeeding chapters. </p>\n<p>I can see this book becoming too terrifying for the average person to read. If you are diagnosed with a psychological disorder or under duress or stress - please read with tremendous caution. But if you have time to see the future in a perspective of a highly open minded person - you might find tremendous benefit from this book. </p>\n<p>I am aiming to answer my fears, outline them and disect each part after the other. I find that this limited time that I have to do this so is enough to force me to write into the night after my days work as an accountant. </p>\n<p>I also recently finished Carl Jung’s book Aion. It was a crazy book. It was something only few can digest. I do not even have the grasp of reality after digesting the contents of it. I lost some taste to my normal routine of consuming a lot of diverging discussions realm of podcasting. But what I might be taking from Aion is somewhat similar as Carl Jung attempted to set a discussion that there is a polarizing imbalance in how we are laying out society. This view is very unpopular at the time that it was provided in the western world. But now, he’s thoughts are resonating in Dr. Jordan Peterson’s books, lectures and interviews. The crack in the disconnection in society is so large that the metaphysical lack is eating up human nature itself - those who are incapable of exercising critical thinking or control are becoming consumed by dangerous ideologies. This cloud of confusion is hindering us from banding together to correct a lot of our mistakes in destroying the natural world, preparing for the technological disruptions and even avoiding the threats of WW3. I will layout my analyses to why I have arrived to such words.</p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic have triggered a chain of events that we are not aware where it will end up. We have clearly released a demon that is so forceful that we will not be able to contain it moving forward into the future. </p>\n<p>TBC.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/cad07/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100.13888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/c739e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/8ee9c/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 148w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/ebbe7/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 295w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/c739e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 590w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/cad07/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 720w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","excerpt":"The multi-variant problem of a degenerating society.
