Most of these problems are sourced out to businesses that operate for a profit - hence. More consumption, more profit, more products, better services - the cycle repeats itself over and over.  </p>\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQE--AdhiXCxcWCg6H1x1MDYDE-Si_r6NU91UUyF1mWqnVkYK6i\" alt=\"foodwaste\" style=\"width: 700px\">\n<p>I find this very alarming due to the amount of resources needed to sustain our wants and needs. I was watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlxySFrkIM\">a short video done by Climate lab and Vox</a> on food wastage and to my shock - we throw everyday 40% of the food that we produce. This is still edible! That’s crazy!!!</p>\n<p>We are approximately 7.7 billion already, growing at a pace of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=rate+of+increase+in+population&#x26;rlz=1C1CHBF_enPH738PH738&#x26;oq=rate+of+increase+in+&#x26;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.10772j0j7&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8\">1.07% per year</a>. It is catastrophic if all humans on earth would try to live like an average american. Experts thinks that we need <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33133712\">four earths</a> to accomodate the natural resources needed.</p>\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRxKbBU-mp9DnSoDiDMjmZYYegrxtOb92l9ouO9pCSY-qm7b2-Gng\" alt=\"charlesdawrwin\" style=\"width: 700px\">\nI find it amazing to reflect on the law of natural selection theorized by Charles Darwin. We came to a point where our human species can create complex systems to support the population, but to madly reflect on how can it not create waste while providing all of us its benefits - there is a limitation in a way. I&apos;m deeply afraid of how things can playout in the near future. The [pacific garbage patch]()\n<p>But where does this system of capitalism will take us?
