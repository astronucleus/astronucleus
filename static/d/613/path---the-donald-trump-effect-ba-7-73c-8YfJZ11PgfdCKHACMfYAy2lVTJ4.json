Let’s start with the bad stuff:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>The power of social and mainstream media.</b> His election inarguably was won through his marketing skills (He’s great at it to be honest), maintream media kept highlighting all of the stupid things that he say all day - non-stop. That is crazy to think that he got around 2 billion dollars worth of free publicity through his rethorics. Social media magnified the problem through its ability to consume the people’s attention 24/7. This a big hole in the way majority of us view the world as we forgot how to think and analyze what is truly beneficial to talk about.. Another example why I keep saying most people are like zombies nowadays. </li>\n<li>Climate Change Denial.</li>\n<li>Lying becomes the new normal.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Wherever you live in this world, Donald Trump has affected your life in a way, mostly bad in my opinion.
