A definitive emergent truth.</p>\n<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is simply a residual of everything we do as humans. Since most of our energy consumption is being supplied by fossil fuels, It’s hard to accept that we, ALL OF US is a part of it. Look at the graph below.</p>\n<img src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Global-CO2-emissions-by-region-since-1751.png\"> \n<p>We created an economy all over the world that reliance to Carbon based fuels is inevitable and led to unnecessary accumulation of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. These gasses are responsible for trapping the heat of sun. </p>\n<p>Below are the problems we will be facing if we fail to act within a decade..</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Polar ice caps melting</b>. The earth is a wonderful ball of chemistry that At present, we have reached a 1% temperature rise from the pre-industrial era (1800s) it is well explained below in the graph. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> Sea level rise\nExtreme heatwaves\nMassive Storms </p>\n<ul>\n<li>War and famine</li>\n<li>Ocean Acidification </li>\n</ul>\n<p>all is probable unless we change our ways of living..</p>\n<p>I studied much of what’s written here in last two weeks..</p>","excerpt":"We have twelve years to correct our economy, culture and heal the planet as per  IPCC  on climate change.
