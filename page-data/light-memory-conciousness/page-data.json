My dream did not have an equation in it but I have a working correlation of different parts of the brain that may relate to answering this problem. My focus when I woke up was seeing how can light particles be the waypoint on how we utilize memory. </p>\n<p>If I understood it correctly from my careful review on how I think, I can perceive and see a certain idea in clear pictures whenever I try to think of a specific thing. Let’s say an apple - I see an apple in its red juicy ripe form now of which I believe to create such apple in my mind we have to tap into the occipital lobe to recreate the perception of an apple while tapping into a “memory” of an apple stored in the cortices. Since the occipital lobe is involved, my understanding is our brain somehow is able to translate memory into light particles that we see while we think. This is becoming too geeky of a writing but yeah I have not heard this structure of correlation from any scientific material before I dreamed of it.</p>\n<p>Well, upon researching around 5AM with this hypothesis I have seen a research facility in Germany that have a very similart hypothesis. Atleast I am not somewhat insane. I should definitely write more about this correlations with light particles, memory and conciousness..</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"I had a strange dream last night..
