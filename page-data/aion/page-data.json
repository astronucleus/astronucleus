But going through those pages allowed me to touch into a different force that a lot of books never have gaved me.</p>\n<p>One of the parts that is truly scary (and true as I have seen it happen to my family) is how a mother can kill her children through her motherly love, insulating the child from harm brought by the young mind - the one who seeks, the curious one. The child unfortunately moves forward into the future without a sword and a fragile shield of limited knowledge, a brittle collection of experience and once tested by the horror of the real world, he is incapable of adapting or breaking out. </p>\n<p>Another thing he pointed out was any person cannot develop himself completely without understanding the shadow - that version of us that can deal tremendous damage to ourselves, the world and people around us. I made a <a href=\"https://tech-stoic.github.io/embodiement-of-the-shadow/\">blog</a> about this before but reading it from Jung himself was reliving the experience of how I have done it for myself. Dr. Peterson talked about this too in his book <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/12-Rules-for-Life-Audiobook/B0797YBP7N\">the 12 rules for life</a> but in a way the average person can understand such. Jung on the other hand goes deep, describing how our primal nature can go out of hand when we fail to see that evil is deeply embedded in how we survived as primal creatures and had evolved to create tribal structures. These ancient connection shows the pieces that puts together that side of us that can deal hurt and suffering - great evil if poorly understood.</p>\n<p>The description on the Anima and the Animus is the part were I stopped but found myself with question marks on how I frame the world as I compare how all of us have a masculine (the animus) and the feminine (the anima) personas exists along with the shadow inside us. Our consciousness is somewhat the mixture of the perspectives of the three plus the wise man (which I have not yet read…). We use the anima / animus as the projection of our partners pattern of thinking. I kindof relate it to how biologically all fetuses start as a female and later develops to a man if the SRY gene (a kind of protein) happen to choose such through random selection. But yeah, it kind of makes sense that we as humans can have the ability to establish the perception of the opposite sex, which makes us more accep ting in a relationship. There were a lot of juicy concepts in this chapter that I fail to remember as I’m writting this post. Hopefully I can cover those in a much better version of this blog.</p>\n<p>Jung have shared clarity through his great insights into our kind - the uniqueness of the human mind that truly create tremendous good or evil. I still need to cover a lot for Aion as I move forward into the future but truly understanding what we are through the eyes of Carl Jung still leads me to corners of my mind I where doors are starting to open up…</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"carljun In parts, I have came across Carl Jung’s ideas wrapped around a lot of Dr. Jordan Peterson’s works… Aion is one of Jung’s creation…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/rational-stoic/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aion","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","rational-stoic"],"date":"July 01, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/aion/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
