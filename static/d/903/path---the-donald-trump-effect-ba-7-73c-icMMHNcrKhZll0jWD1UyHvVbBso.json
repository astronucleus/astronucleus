That is crazy to think that he got around 2 billion dollars worth of free publicity through his rethorics. Social media magnified the problem through its ability to consume the people’s attention 24/7. This a big hole in the way majority of us view the world as we forgot how to think and analyze what is truly beneficial to talk about.. Another example why I keep saying most people are like zombies nowadays. I got in to a heated argument with a girl in Thailand before by just explaining how I have perceived of him winning the election against another bad apple - Hilary Clinton. </li>\n<li><b>Lying becomes the new normal.</b> He is insane, not insidious - yet. He keeps talking about putting a wall to guard Mexico from bringing drugs and guns to his country. He speaks of it like it is a crisis that his country needs to pay attention, painting a picture of dire state of emergency but then he still keeps golfing on the weekend for 6 hours.. His delusion about what he wants to promote as a right he acquired from winning the oval office is so amazing and stupid at the same time that the strongest economy in the world is being ran by a guy that is the king of lies. I had a friend whom I met in Palawan from the US wherein she had gone traveling since Trump won and she basically doesn’t want to comeback until things change.</li>\n<li><b>Climate Change Denial.</b> This a big one. He is pulling civilization back just by denying climate change. It would be okay if he is just a president of a small country but it’s not the case. He is supposed to be the most influential person to address the impending doom but he keeps on protecting the fossil fuel industry. We all know that there is tremendous money in it for him to do such but is it really worth it? going to be written in the history books that you are one of the most stupid person to walk the face of the planet? ow men this one literally burns people as a lot die of heat waves all over the world. It’s not that he’s to blame to all of global warming but come on - power is supposed to be used for the good in the modern times and not to serve certain groups of people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s not all bad with the “Donald Trump Effect”, Let’s talk about how he is somewhat causing some good in the world..</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Intellectual Dark Web and Podcast.</b> The IDW is a group of amazing people who focuses on making sense of what is happening all around us. They could be the replacement for traditional media as the knowledge that you can acquire for them is really worth your time. I personally follow Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, <a href=\"\">Sam Harris</a>, <a href=\"\">Bret Weinstein</a> and <a href=\"\">Joe Rogan</a> as they do this talks that is so amazing and their arguments becomes tools that fortifies my view about the world. I also listen to a bit of Jocko Willink’s <a href=\"\">podcast</a> for he has a lot of sensible arguments to reflect upon. They</li>\n<li><b>People are waking up.</b></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Wherever you live in this world, Donald Trump has affected your life in a way, mostly bad.
