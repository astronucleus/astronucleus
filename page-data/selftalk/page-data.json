I guess doing this in the modern age is harder now because of the oceans of data that we cannot in our lifetime filter - dwarfing our capacity to make sound choices in the moments we need to do such.</p>\n<p>I guess our ancestors are more focused before trying to dilute each day on deciding how to reproduce, what to eat and finding safety. Nowadays, we are now bombarded with so many tiny seemingly unharmful decisions yet causes confusion, anxiety, stress and depression. Imagine needing a job in an environment where there is no job at all. Then you compare that to an ancient hominid where his task is just to hunt a deer. There is no law as to how many he can kill, there are no governments - just free for all hominids. </p>\n<p>Well, I’m not saying that it is easier before like our ancestors need also to factor that they are also a prey for bigger and much stronger predators. What I’m saying now is the modern times makes us think of thousands of variables just to arrive at a certain decision like trying to go to the restaurant or buying food in the grocery. Its just ways different and our body and brain is not adapted to it.</p>\n<p>Well, the future generations will hopefully understand our path moving forward…but that is if we get to fix the looming problems caused by the pandemic and climate disruptions…</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"This constant self-talk is becoming a new normal for me…I guess there is no alternative to this..
