I have been studying such for two months already and still I want more of it. It brought me to interesting paths of empathy towards people that caused me great harm and also allowed me to reflect a lot with how I handled my decisions in the past. But another thing that strikes me is that our human capacity to coordinate with each other to create chaos against groups of people to whom we are not affiliated with… our capacity to start and implement wars..</p>\n<p>Wars are one of the worst tools ever wielded by humanity. We are not the only animals who can band into groups and destroy other species but our degree of sophistication on to implementing violence and damages is unfathomable. We can create guns that allows us to eliminate targets with precision. We also created economies around violence - private armies, armaments, ammunition and the list goes on. Cyber attacks and social media campaigns are being carried out by nations to distabilize others. We are really too technologically powerful nowadays to the point that I wouldn’t be suprised to see robots weilding rockets in the future. </p>\n<p>No one can escape the strands of impact wars have caused. Everyone in this world have been forged over 3.6 million years of war starting from our primal ancestors trying to stay alive to warlords carving their swords and spears to become momentary Gods of multiple lands. </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/32325e5a864932fc2d3ccf5a51aa0e1d/a1d65/genghizkhan.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 49.89473684210526%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"genghizkhan\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/32325e5a864932fc2d3ccf5a51aa0e1d/f8fb9/genghizkhan.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/32325e5a864932fc2d3ccf5a51aa0e1d/e8976/genghizkhan.jpg 148w,\n/static/32325e5a864932fc2d3ccf5a51aa0e1d/63df2/genghizkhan.jpg 295w,\n/static/32325e5a864932fc2d3ccf5a51aa0e1d/f8fb9/genghizkhan.jpg 590w,\n/static/32325e5a864932fc2d3ccf5a51aa0e1d/85e3d/genghizkhan.jpg 885w,\n/static/32325e5a864932fc2d3ccf5a51aa0e1d/a1d65/genghizkhan.jpg 950w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Genghis Khan is one of the few of us who have changed the path of history - using war as a tool to implement his own aspirations for the world to follow.
