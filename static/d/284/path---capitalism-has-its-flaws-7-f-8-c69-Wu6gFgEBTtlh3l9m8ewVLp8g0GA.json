I love capitalism. It allows me to enjoy the benefits of a society that was built by talent, education and progress. Never in our lifetime have existed 7.7 billion people that can enjoy the resources of this planet and use it to improve all of humanities living standards without the threat of war. It is truly amazing to live in this moment. Even a guy like me can learn about anything, use rectangular boxes called computers to communicate a message through a website and published through other box devices like smartphones while housing the information in box servers. </p>\n<p>But I have dire hopes that capitalism is the way forward. Though the thought that all of our societies best benefits is built on this concept, I see its flaws now revealing itself. Information on this is truly scary.</p>\n<p>I have seen capitalism in Africa and my firsthand experience with them it is not my best performance as a human being. I’m not proud of helping a government steal oil from its country’s resources and transfer it to the president’s family business. Capitalism became a way wherein corruption got out of hand. That is also the case for Nigeria, Somalia and Democatice Republic of Congo.  </p>","excerpt":"Don’t get me wrong. I love capitalism.
