I hope to capture the history &#x26; process (also arguements) on why I corrected my beliefs about religion (and truth) in this blog post. I hope you can draw very useful ideas in my attempt to capture my own thoughts. </p>\n<p>Born to a poor family in San Ildefonso a town 2 hours from Manila, our nation’s Capital in 1985, this is where I honed my childhood.\nFor the most part of my childhood, I am serving the local church as an altar boy..even got medals for it.\nAll of my friends did the same. My whole family did too. I was so proud in serving the weekly-evening-saturday-mass. I always felt that I was the cool person helping spread the word of God.</p>\n<!-- \n<img src=\"\" alt=\"university\" style=\"width: 700px\">\n\nMaybe my view-point changed a little bit when I started my university studies. In my second year, I was able to answer a very difficult problem by deducting environmental effects as to how greeks became the creators of the scientific approach and birthed philosophy. Also, things doesn't add up.. The very people that taught me to adhere to catholic virtues seem to sway away from it. At the back of my head something is missing and but paralyzed of my incapacity to understand the core of it. \n -->\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRw9KkDZPkPHMq65GtSnPPnu1jIBSkVVo8xx6o9z78xAx1Z4wH5\" alt=\"christianity\" style=\"width: 700px\">\n<p>During my board examinations for praticing public and private accounting, I reconnected with my inner desire to connect with the creator. Most of our instructors explain the role of “God handling the things that we can’t control” during the seven months of review and tests. Things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worst room airconditioning. It takes 3 excruciating hours for each exam at the time. Room selection is random and based on your last name and selected schools by the Board of Accountancy. </li>\n<li>Eating spoiled food causing bad stomach. Some fix this problem by bringing packed lunch.</li>\n<li>Forgetting to bring important stuff like your exam passes or IDs. With the millions of topics covered in the exams, it is easy to neglect things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arriving late stops you from entering the examination rooms. Stress. Traffic. A lot of reasons. You get the picture.</p>\n<p>Working in a Christian owned-company then threw me again to friday morning christian gatherings. Not entirely catholic but use the bible to reflect on the hardships daily living in general. This is somewhat mandatory for me as I am handling a department at the time.</p>\n<p>In our country, you don’t have a choice but acknowledge the role of a creator that you can refer prayers\nAnywhere you go, until you cease to exist..there you will bump into religious influence as I am describing in my stories. </p>\n<p>After learning computer coding and climate science back in October (2018), I pondered much on my inability to create software projects. Seeking to be more productive in getting more out of my free time, I focused on studying astronomy and philosophy. I’ll un-wrap these two bodies of science..</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As described in wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\">Philosophy (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally “love of wisdom”) is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language</a>. This body of science is massive in its own as it discusses the most controversial ideas ever to exist to us humans including yes - the existence of a creator. Studying a couple of materials (like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNgK6MZucdYldNkMybYIHKR\">CrashCourse</a>) and discussions of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins\">Richard Dawkins</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris\">Sam Harris</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson\">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> became the pillars of how I approach the world.  Since the we refer to the world</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I were to have a hand in my fate as to where I should start this life of sacrifice and struggle I wouldn’t choose a developing country hampered by ideas that don’t have any truthful basis but unfortunately we don’t get the chance to choose our birth parents. I hope you find my personal take on the role of religion to our civilization and current state insightful.</p>","excerpt":"We don’t choose our parents and most people would not reflect on that because there is no incentive in it.
