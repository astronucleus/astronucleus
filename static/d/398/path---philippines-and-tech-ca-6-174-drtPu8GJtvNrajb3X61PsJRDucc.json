Thus, we are falling far behind in the area of innovation.</p>\n<p>The long answer:</p>\n<p>As the world is rapidly evolving, I honestly believe that my home country is not being able to adapt to the current trends. Take a look at these problems..</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It is estimated that the country loses <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/970553/jica-traffic-congestion-now-costs-p3-5-billion-a-day-metro-manila-traffic-jica-cost-of-traffic\">3.5 billion pesos (66 million USD)</a> in traffic everyday. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Degredation of natural resources is already affecting human lives. <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/212703-how-itogon-benguet-naga-cebu-landslides-are-alike\">Soil erosion killed 90 people</a> and others missing in two separate locations in a span of a week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1108534.pdf\">2016 study</a> shows that as a country, we are producing students incapable of adopting to the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Food supply have been an issue in the recent months. <a href=\"https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2018/08/30/Philippine-rice-crisis-escalates-as-shortages-push-prices-to-a-three-year-high\">Rice shortage</a> is a three year high. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these problems have plagued us for the last decade and shows evidence that we are not coping with the growing population and degredation of natural resources. As the under-educated population gets bigger and bigger, it then magnifies the problem leading to more loses in time, resources, opportunity and even lives. What I meant by under-educated Filipinos are the ones who decide to just complain about the situation and just follow the big three (this is why I don’t watch the news at all). I believe a large number of the population has this mindset.</p>\n<p>My own opinion to the role of technology and what is possible?</p>\n<p>History shows that the massive improvements we enjoyed in the 1.8 million years of existence of humans were <a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/19-great-inventions-that-revolutionized-history\">all attributable to technology</a>. Technology is a “mindset” that a nation should adopt. Innovation is a must if one will want a more favorable result as using old methods to solve the same old problems will always have the same outcome.  </p>\n<p>I applaud our president Rodrigo Duterte and his administration for their accomplishments. But the magnitude of problems currently being handled by the government will not be solved with the current technologies that we apply. Traffic will not be solved by more roads and it can be solved by self-driving cars. Jobs can only be created through changing our curriculums to include coding and languages as core subjects. We should use vertical farms to alleviate the problems of food shortages. Smart cities should be implemented instead of people living in high risk areas of flooding and soil erosion. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just two options.. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adapt - Take bold risks, investments and insights from other countries. There is a mars mission now and rockets return to earth automatically, virtually every problem can be solved.</li>\n<li>Die - Yes, die slowly. Failing to accept the role of technology causes more problems because it adds up to the old problems a nation already have. Death as a nation is possible if we fail to innovate. More people will</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","excerpt":"Why does India have a space program and our country does not even care about this question at all?
