Peterson..</p>\n<p>If you have watched the movie Avengers: Infinity Wars where this scene wherein Thor came back to earth and <a href=\"\">threw his hammer to Thanos</a> and then this villain said “You should have aimed for the head..” - Dr. Peterson quite got me on some level where he have hit the holes in my belief that resides in my head for the past decades.. some even when I was still a child. </p>\n<p>There are voices that trust how God will direct me after a worst situation.\nDon’t do Evil. Even though I try to implement this over the track of my life, unfortunately it is rather difficult to not hurt people as we strive to exist as truthfully as possible. Truth hurts pretty bad.</p>","excerpt":"This is my second post about Dr. Peterson.
