I’m in fear that I make a dumb move that will hinder me from adapting to what can happen. This might just be over thinking or am I going insane? I’m pretty sure I am not…</p>\n<p>Let me outline why I am not crazy and not over thinking what can play out in the future. I naturally gravitate to any form of information. Each pattern, idea or experience gives me a certain piece that I can find relevance to the grand scheme of things. What are these things that are in play that I am being drawn into?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technological disruptions - Artificial intelligence analyzing our daily clicks and searches, disruption in the job markets</li>\n<li>Ideological constructs - Postmodernism, polictical divide, geopolitics, capitalism going corrupt, marxism and socialism</li>\n<li>Climate disruption due to excessive use of non-renewable resources</li>\n<li>Poor health at scale - sugar and carbohydrates, overuse of antibiotics, medical fields becoming corrupt</li>\n<li>Threat of war - China vs. the world</li>\n<li>The effect of COVID to the economy and immigration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a lot of things still that bothers me, yet this list is tremendously big enough to understand. Maybe drafting a book about trying to understand these forces is a great idea. Maybe this might tip myself to insanity instead? I guess not. I should write more about this. </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/3d90e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100.13888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/4b3ab/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/f8bb1/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 148w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/900ac/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 295w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/4b3ab/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 590w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/3d90e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 720w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","excerpt":"I’m still struggling to understand what is happening in the world now…too many factors to concider on to what direction I can take…I’m…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/rational-stoic/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Drafting a book?","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","rational-stoic"],"date":"July 12, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/writing-a-draft-for-book copy-v2/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
