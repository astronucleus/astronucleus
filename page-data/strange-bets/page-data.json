Maybe that is the idea behind this questions inside my head, analyzing a scenario of living Cayman Islands much earlier than I previously thought I will as staying for five years have really crossed my brain…but yet I the pandemic have touched a narrative that I see now coming alive from the stories that I have read in history - nothing is certain and change is quite constant.</p>\n<p>Though I know at the basic level of my stoic virtues emerge a very simplistic approach to life as the control beyond myself is discarded…living in cayman bugs me that if the economic fallout fall deeper, supply and demand might flip a swicth that can cause my stoic virtues to be thrown out of the window. This is hyper speculative - but then again the last six months was that, super speculation causing the largest loss of wealth in the last 100 years. This is some kind of a lost decade as Ray Dalio explained in one of his recent talks - I guess betting is now warranted, risks are unavoidable and exploring strange bets is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Now back to New Zealand a my next destination, this is really gripping me. Two friends of mine highlighted New Zealand in the past three months, signifying perhaps its stability yet at the time I was not yet drooling over this foreign land. I am still learning about the place but what I have seen in Cayman, what worked here that worked as well in NZ was people helping and cooperating with the government. NZ and Cayman is similar in that - the residents taking responsibility to safeguard the nation. Though Cayman is such a wonderful place, its limited land creeps into the loss of resources that migrant residents can utilize. That idea draws me to western states like Canada, the first one that I constantly fantasized with. But the proliferation of bad ideas in the americas caused me to consider options like NZ. Cayman is great, but I want my future kids to gain a better fight for the future and I believe Cayman Islands can’t support that idea. The search for a home base is still on.</p>\n<p>Now, NZ has one downside that I am constantly bugged…it is ill positioned to climate changes, as in the next fifty years the world will become more hotter because we are unable to get ourselves together to wake up to this crisis. Canada and Europe is better positioned for this. Yet we are still needing to see a more clearer estimate on how a hotter world would really unfold the cascading changes, I still need to come to grip with the reality of solving the fundamental problem of a third world born citizen, deprived of the western culture - causing a rippling effect to his lineage moving into the future. </p>\n<p>Hmmmmm I’m more likely to move out of Cayman Islands by the end of 2021 unless another significant turn of event will unfold and\nbend the hands of fate out of my favor…well, this is the world we live in right now. Facing it with strange bets is the only option.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"In this blog post, I’ll be thinking ahead…a year from now…what are my options…?
