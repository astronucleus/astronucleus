I use code available in github as open-source. I use a smartphone to aid me in my studies. I use YouTube, Udemy and Coursera to watch a lot of free courses. I use my profession as an accountant to earn money. I use money to fund my experiments. I use my favorite coffe cup to drink coffee without sugar. I use the television to bond with my mom.  </p>\n<p>Tools. We are not the only animals who could wield things. Chimpanzees use sticks to get termites from holes. Rocks for nuts, crushed leaves for water. True to fact, we were just so lucky to have discovered fire - this tool have given us enough to create warmth in a cold climates (yes, we survived an ice age..), defend ourselves from predators and most important of it all - the ability to cook food. </p>\n<p>The ability to cook food have been theorized by experts to have enabled the growth of our neo-cortex - the part of our brain that allows us to memorize, utter sounds and advanced frame of sight. I don’t like cooking but after learning this fact, I have utmost respect to our ancestral connection in weilding the pot and spatula.</p>\n<p>Language is a tool that separates us apart from the animal kingdom. We can customize our thoughts through the amount of language that we can memorize and utter to our peers.</p>\n<p>Money is a tool that separates us in a way. We divide our world withstanding to the amount of riches one has. Statistics show that if you earn 34,000 USD, you are part of the 1% of the world. The remaining 99% of the world lives on the average of <a href=\"\">XXX USD</a>.</p>\n<p>Going back to my opening statement.. not all people use the tools that I use in the same manner. I would argue that 99% of the world thought of their jobs as their identity. I was like that before but when it came to a point that your profession is not responding as it should to reasons beyond your control - the situation you are in will bite you.</p>","excerpt":"I use a computer to code.
