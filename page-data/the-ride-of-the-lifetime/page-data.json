Uncertainties created by weaknesseses of systems like globalism, capitalism and the western beliefs provides a widening gap to establishing a world where we can be able solve the current pandemic crisis, economic fallout and earth’s continued warming…I even have concluded that I am five years late from migrating to North America or Europe..But…</p>\n<p>As hilariously absurd the bowl of soup the world is swimming in, there is a kind of meaning that still is emerging from the multi-variant crisis humanity is facing collectively. History is becoming a great guide for me especially in this crisis where it tries to model out the chaos-order dynamic as creation comes out of the destruction. Unfortunately, we have to see more suffering and death first before things get better…and it can ripple to even cycle out to hundreds of years before things get better. Since meaning is derived through suffering, this period is that…where humanity will derive the most meaning ever to be recorded as creating tremendous documentation through videos, podcasts or blogs. </p>\n<p>I just hope that in this process, we come out much more smarter… I guess only time will hold the answers, perhaps I will be part of those ones who will continously observe and provide deeper thoughts to the dynamics of how the world is changing…continously writing about this void of uncertainty might be where I will derive my personal answer for a meaningful application of my time spent in this world. </p>","excerpt":"rationalstoic What if I would think of the best possible opportunity to realize from the ongoing economic fallout, pandemic and climate…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/book-project/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"The greatest story ever told?","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","book-project"],"date":"August 31, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-ride-of-the-lifetime/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
