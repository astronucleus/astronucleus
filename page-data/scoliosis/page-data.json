Yes, scoliosis. I have it. A C-type based on the x-ray slide she showed me. </p>\n<p>There’s no direct explanation on how people acquires scoliosis. Some say its genetic or triggered by the person’s environment but the sources I’ve read are not clear. I just feel victimized by how I learned about my situation. I had a medical inspection two months ago that included checking my back. Why was it not even mentioned? Is the medical community designed to conceal information until a certain case or problem is big enough to bring a patient back for profits? My case is not painful so it is not a big concern yet.</p>\n<p>I normally reflect on death and how fragile our lives can be. That is why I do a lot of exercises to maintain a capable body. I eat food while being aware of pros and cons. I do not put sugar in my coffee. I love a strong and healthy anatomy because it equates to a powerful mind. Learning about my scoliosis, I now have a reason to do yoga which is a good thing. Did some specific exercises targeted for my case and I felt really good after. I still need to improve my core muscles so yeah this turned out to be a positive thing.</p>","excerpt":"This is the best way to capture what the radiologist said about my spine. Yes, scoliosis.
