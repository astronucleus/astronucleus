Yet, most of us navigate our daily lives like food is not a big part of it as far as planning for the future. But in my experience for the past year doing a customized ketogenic / primal diet…it is a big factor to my improvement in overall health, stable energy levels and cognitive clarity.</p>\n<p>Putting sugar in almost all of our meals became one of the biggest problems that we have produced because of corruption and capitalism. Regulatory bodies and scientists that can guard and guide us in understanding and providing legislation to control prevalence of carbohydrates in the food was overriden by the allure of monetary benefit. Sadly, in the pursuit of improving valuations of companies, the capitalistic motivation gets derailed and tend to dispense ethical or moral layers of safeguarding consumers. </p>\n<p>It is very hard to go against the perfect storm. Filipino culture tends to favor Chinese and American taste which are heavily leaning into a lot of unhealthy food resources. Trying to create a fortitude that can transcend a healthy mind and body in an environment built to not support it is kind of moronic to the average mind. But pushing against mediocre yet powerful culture of nutrition yields the strongest mindset in my experience. It is not easy as everyone wants you to stop what you are doing.</p>\n<p>I guess this blog needs more unpacking as it is quite important to expand on this topic.

Yeah, I should write more stuff to this topic…</p>","excerpt":"Nutrition could be so problematic as in hindsight, once future humans will figure this lexicon out and say this mush have been one of our…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/book-project/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nutrition","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","book-project"],"date":"September 08, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/nutrition-marathon-ep1/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
