I downloaded a picture from the web of Kevin Richardson and used it as a layer to the app canvas. I then lowered the brightness and so it became my guide for shades, sketches while listening to an audio book about individuation. It was a well worth use of time to sit down, exercise my tiny hand muscles to improve my dexterity in guiding the s-pen to whatever curves or shades I needed to recreate the Lion and Kevin. </p>\n<p>Most meaningful experiences in life needs time and focus - like the eagle focusing on his prey from above. I see it as a painful process most of the time as there are resistance inside us that is like screaming to prevent us from trying to maximize what we need to accomplish. It is somewhat the shadow in Carl Jung’s individuation process - when we fail to realize that part of us that can hurt us, we fail to realize the potential that is hiding inside us. </p>\n<p>The default mechanism is we avoid complexity all the time if possible. We solve problems as quickly or easily. But this frame of action hinders us from making significant strides in meaningful pursuits like art, music, parenting or friendships… The responsibility entangled inside us makes the resistance stronger to the point we need to uptick our game in to managing it.  </p>\n<p>Most cannot do it, even I am so guilty of it. I easily waste time on watching videos recently or playing games. It’s just one click of the smartphone. I guess the primordial part of me is so strong that it gets the hold of my critical thinking and stoic practices. I guess I have to strengthen my reasons again, why I do things… for me this is the most compelling way into managing the resistance to do great work. Yeah that is the way forward.</p>\n<p>To finish this short blog, I guess focus is so hard to find in the chaos of the pandemic that is enveloping society, I wish I can manage to write more stuff again and edit / create videos of great value. I may found more reasons now to move forward - new reasons to live better. Hope to build on this new steps, create more, do more…</p>","excerpt":"The ability to create resides into our decision to allocate tremendous amount of time to focus… It took me an hour and a half to create this…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Focus","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art"],"date":"January 25, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/focus copy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
