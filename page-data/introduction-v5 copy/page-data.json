We are entering a new world order and seeing modern systems collapse in stronger nations and weaker nations go down on their knees, there is a compelling need to understand what is happening…put an dire effort to pull my own shit together as the realities of blood and sorrow is haunting each corner of my mind whenever I step out of our office. I need to write everything I am capable of understanding, discover a narrative for the ones that I cannot and perhaps navigate the future in between…</p>\n<p>I work as a professional accountant in Cayman Islands and originally from the Philippines. Here its clearly going back to some kind of normalcy. But it is not the case for most, as a lot of repatriation flights were already made. Thousands of people already left the island as the economic fallout clinched their fate. They were not able to evade its sharp tentacles. </p>\n<p>I believe my curiosity on studying philosophical and neurological texts have cracked a hole into a narrative of debunking the absurdities of deep tomes of knowledges that all of us are simply accepting as systems for how we navigate our daily lives. I  somehow can look at ideologies and even contradicting perspectives - may it be in biology, computer programming, business and economics. I’m became highly receptive to the way we operate classify problems and the methods that solve them. But the saddest part of this gift (or burden) is I somehow see far into the future and all I can see are the problems as most of us are kindof bounded - we are limited systems that are embeded from the moment we are born into this world. There will be blood and suffering to be had if we cannot grasp what layers complexities lies ahead all of us. We are losing the grip to what made the past 70 years the best period in human history. The multi-variant problem of a degenerating society is now starting to unfold. </p>\n<p>We lack the societal design to solve what are often times in front of us. To develop modern methods and technologies that solve bleak realities like plastic pollution or climate change, our minds are preoccupied with so many tiny unimportant and important decisions that drives our second by second activities, thus ignoring the lurking doom happening now that increasingly vacuums us to tremendous uncertainty.</p>\n<p>I deal with these self talk everyday. Even though as I try to live like a stoic and feeling okay most of the time and living as part of the richest group of people that ever walked the face of the planet as judge by historical standards, what demons that will come out from our past decisions keeps me thinking like a crackpot almost all the time. </p>\n<p>I fear for myself but I fear more for people whom have invested their whole life to mediocrity. A poor recognition of meta and phyisical reality can greatly affect one’s fate, let alone at societal level where the average person thrives in the mediocrity of losing their time in a handheld device.</p>\n<p>I am aiming to answer my fears, outline them and disect each part after the other. I find that this limited time that I have to do this so is enough to force me to write into the night after my days work as an accountant. I recently finished Carl Jung’s book - Aion. It was a crazy book. I do not even have the grasp of reality after digesting the contents of it. I lost some taste to my normal routine of consuming a lot of diverging discussions in Jung’s realm. But what I might be taking from Aion is somewhat similar as Carl Jung attempted to set a discussion starting from the 1950s, explaining in his various books that there is a polarizing imbalance in how we are laying out the foundations of society as a whole. </p>\n<p>This view is very unpopular at the time that it was provided in the western world. But now, he’s thoughts are resonating in Dr. Jordan Peterson’s books, lectures and interviews. The crack in the disconnection in society is so large that the metaphysical lack is eating up human nature itself - those who are incapable of exercising critical thinking or control are becoming consumed by dangerous ideologies. This cloud of confusion is hindering us from banding together to correct a lot of our mistakes in destroying the natural world, preparing for the technological disruptions and even avoiding the threats of WW3. I will layout my analyses to why I have arrived to such words.</p>\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic have triggered a chain of events that we are not aware where it will end up. We have clearly released a demon forcing to us to bleed each drop of progress the 20th century have achieved. I hope to be able to explain everything to myself. I hope I’m intelligent enough to discover a the answers I’m seeking to understand the insanity..</p>\n<p>I will try to outline the problems I see in great detail, these will constitute the first part of this book. The second part will constitute how this problems overlay to each other as I see most of them interplaying with each other and making things more complex. Lastly, the third part…If there is a solution to these rabbit hole we have found ourselves into, are we as a society able to do such? or we are spinning downward to tremendous uncertainty.</p>\n<p>I can see this book becoming too terrifying for the average person to read. If you are diagnosed with a psychological disorder or under duress or stress - please read and explore the my ideas with tremendous caution. I’m very grateful that if you decided to join me in this journey of seeking the solutions or complexities of the next five to ten years - you might find tremendous benefit from this book. Most book fail to relate the current dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic and I will try to add that layer to the topics that have been discussed in the last fifty years by experts on history and the sciences.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/3d90e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 100.13888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/4b3ab/rationalstoiclogo.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/f8bb1/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 148w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/900ac/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 295w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/4b3ab/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 590w,\n/static/8b061b71f4c488203b296abdf7f30c34/3d90e/rationalstoiclogo.jpg 720w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>","excerpt":"Version 6..
