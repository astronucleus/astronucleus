And writing about this practice over and over again should not be taken forgranted. The mere ability to write is to be thankful for.. the mere fact that we breath air everytime we wake up is truly amazing. The miracle of our body to have an ability to feel emotion and be able to have a chance to reflect is worth savoring.</p>\n<p>There is just too much small but essential things to think about, instead of wasting our time worrying ourselves of problems. </p>\n<p>Consider the people in Syria or Sub-saharan Africa where they can’t seem to perceive if they can live tomorrow..\nRape victims who simply cannot break the pattern of suffering. People that are in grief to the disasters caused by super typhoons or massive earthquakes. People who don’t have money to buy them a meal or a piece of clothing.</p>\n<p>Be thankful that you or I don’t have this kinds of situations. Be thankful of the opportunity to talk to your parents or friends overseas. Be thankful that you have time to create art or write a blog. </p>\n<p>Write the answer to this question the moment you wake up: </p>\n<p><em>“What am I grateful for today?”</em> </p>\n<p>And trust me, you will look at things much better as you frame the day with optimism. Be grateful. Everyday. </p>","excerpt":"Not the first time I’m writing about gratitude but I couldn’t help but simply apply the concept everyday..
