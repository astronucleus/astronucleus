It is easier to take a step back after sometime, it is impossible to see your mistake while you are doing it. Bias is part of human nature and cannot be easily scrapped out in our decision making, most especially when we are wired not to evaluate ourselves.</p>\n<p>This was a drawback of starting your life in a third world country. Self-awareness is not on the radar of everyone, corrupt government and media tells you what to do in life. Brain after getting drunked of all the bad news, easily stressed then attracted to doing the easy stuff. Watch movies, watch the news, eat sugar laced food have, lie and deceit these are the easy stuff. It is very easy to create bad habits. Bad habits are intertwined as “normal things to do”. </p>\n<p>I lived in the islands before and it was easy for them to receive money from politicians in exchange of votes. More and more people become obese. Free will is not true. The environment we live in determine the preconditions of our mindset. This includes social media, television, and even your friends have a direct influence in what you do. </p>\n<p>Even though we feel that our decision is our own, it is not our own..it is rather heavily relying on our emotions… emotions that are driven by necessity.. needs that where dependent of our environment.. </p>","excerpt":"I got saved from my foolishness.
