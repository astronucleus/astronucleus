It is deeply troubling, we cannot go back to how we are living before the pandemic and the feedback loop keeps growing more and more, a highly distorted modern society is too confused to bother even the hellish situation the natural world is in. </p>\n<p>Clearly we are losing the battle and collectively we are not in a position to emerge from this deep hole. We are not capable of thinking as a society. Biases, flickering smartphones, turning every breeding ground of ideas into political warzones…we are so incapable of turning the tide to our favor.</p>\n<p>When I was younger, I believed there is hope for humanity to unite if some kind of devastating situation sends waves of worry and clarity will spread as the need rises. Unfortunately, I did not factor at the time that we have biological components -neural networks that can be hi-jacked by corporations or institutions. Technologies and ideologies became a fatal flaw for this period of humanity, where in the average person is incapable of swimming through the tremendous ocean of data and ambiguity. </p>\n<p>Humanity is in the brink of losing the battle, this is clearly how its playing out. This is how we will destroy all the amazing achievements we were able to enjoy - including the natural world that is bleeding, clearly on its knees…</p>\n<p>Anywhere we look. Animals on land and air losing their numbers and territories, trees and plants burning into ashes through widespread wildfires, the poles losing sea ice, melting at an alarming rate and oceans continuing to get warmer while tremendous trash every year is being mixed into marine life. Clearly, we are the best living organism this world had created, but  co-equally we are its worst creation too. </p>\n<p>As a stoic, what I can do - probably, create more content that will speak more of the dire realities unfolding. I can keep seeking volunteering work to the realm of my skillset. Probably teach the youth and makesure I am able to become part of the few who will help build the next chapter, or foster the next generation that will pioneer the transition..As a stoic, there is only so much I can do. </p>\n<hr>","excerpt":"The polar ice caps continue to lose its mass of ice at a rapid rate, creating a looming feedback loop that will trigger the chaos will tilt…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/projects/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/stoic-letters/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"A stoic letter, the weakening natural world..","tags":["blog","projects","creating-art","stoic-letters"],"date":"November 02, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/stoic-letter-no3/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
