I’m studying Global Sustainability Management at the Technical University of Denmark.  I’m 40% done already and hopefully finish it before I get a job overseas.  </p>\n<p>I also realized how hard it is to write stuff that matters. That also forced me to do a course on writing. </p>\n<p>Focusing on strengths was the theme of my professional career as an accountant. I am tech savy and hyper productive. But these are my strengths, being good at these areas do maintain my edge but does not elevate it. That is why I am exploring my weaknesses for the past six months. I just want to remove my own hard limits as I want to adapt to a technological future that is coming much sooner than most think.</p>","excerpt":"I did not write anything in the past 10 days, due to craving knowledge in a number of different disciplines.
