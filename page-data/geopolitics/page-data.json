US was very vocal on pulling out the production manufacturing of medical supplies and equipments. Japan is taking it to higher level and pushing for trillions of yen to remove local companies from their dependence on China and including options on reinvesting it to other countries.</li>\n<li><strong>Lawsuits against Chinese Communist Party.</strong> A number of nations have raised their concerns on how the CCP (with the help of WHO) concealed the knowledge of human to human transmission of the virus and thus allowing the spread through air and sea travel. Brazil, UK and US entities have filed cases and would be interesting to see where does this push through moving forward as the CCP did really cross the line.</li>\n<li><strong>European Union’s 500 billion euros stimulus package.</strong> This is a measure that I have been looking at for the past weeks to restart the economies as it will be impossible for smaller companies to sustain the immediate economic shock of the lockdown. This is also a great thing to see as there is now visible cooperation between member states after seeing them  took a nationalistic approach on tackling the pandemic.</li>\n<li><strong>The looming need to help third-world countries.</strong> Though there is a slowing down of the virus seen in the West, there is still this big problem that no one still getting a grasp with. The lack of medical infrastructure might trigger tremendous number of unecessary deaths and ripple to the overall global peace and equilibrium. I’m interested on how the west will tackle this challenge, discussions about this is now kickstarting…</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly, this is just an initial understanding of how the stronger nations are will be required to fuel the re-balancing of the world. I’m more optimistic as well in how the United states is responding to the needs its own nation and the ideas beyond the pandemic. They are paying attention for the betterment of the future. Well there is also their elections that is so polarizing -which has again global rippling effects. Again, only time will tell how my initial understanding will change. </p>","excerpt":"I had no choice but to study how political initiatives at a global scale works…I was fascinated on learning about the people and nations…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/blog/","/tags/coronavirus/","/tags/history/","/tags/creating-art/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Geopolitics in a pandemic","tags":["blog","coronavirus","history","creating-art"],"date":"April 09, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/geopolitics/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
