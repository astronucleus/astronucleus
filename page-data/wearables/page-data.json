I ended up not liking my lack of self control in a way, maybe my brain structured to be curious with great people’s perspective and got the habit of comparing my views to theirs. I guess after studying the universe for the past four years now, I have grown a hunger to satisfy my curiosity and the buds helped me skyrocket my adaptation at work as this tool enabled a ton of capabilities that a conventional earphones gives.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It has a has a very good range for allowing me to do stuff a far from my phone. Great for all sorts of stuff like, cooking, working and cycling.</li>\n<li>And yes, cycling - wearing this enabled me to stream info to my brain without the inconvenience of wires wrapping around my body (I tried that though for a few months before a co-worker went to Miami to get me my first buds) and the waterproofing enables it to be worn without threat to rain or sweating. I did had it tumbling down to some waterspots and just worked fine after drying. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The case aint waterproof so that I got myself spending for another pair just to get a charger. Well probably its a great buy since it can extend the lifetime of my buds (a.k.a Green) as the new pair (a.k.a Black) will be down for a lot of usage and spreads usage of the older buds.</p>\n<p>I guess I can still do with stringed earphones but my take on this tech is its so beneficial to my daily activities and the time and effort I save is well spent on other stuff.</p>\n<p>PS. This is day three of my one week challenge to myself to write everyday. I’m trying to re-awaken my writing mechanics as I have gone lazy and procastinating the past months due to forces like the pandemic and researching a lot about postmodern mayhem that is lurking in the background. Hope this can help me expand again my horizon focusing my ideas, learning more about the universe and beyond. </p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"I tossed my galaxy buds case into the washing machine for 45 minutes..
