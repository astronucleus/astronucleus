There is no escaping the hardships of life…there is no alternative to focusing on improving..</em></strong></p>\n<p>I guess when I understood that the meaning of life I have been searching all along was within my grasp, I focused on harnessing it and maximize my finite time in this world. I learned that every struggle, chaos and mealevolence we encounter is a constant, the suffering that we accept and solve every time we encounter it is where we derive meaning. I found this idea very useful in maintaining my sanity especially when the going gets rough.</p>\n<p>Accepting that we have a duty to be a responsible member of the society that we are in at any moment creates an open minded buffer that can adapt to understanding each struggle, each pain and each drop of sweat. Accepting that we are subjected to pain all the time negates bad things when they do occur and allows us to make better decisions. </p>\n<p>This is a short blog, but I guess the realistic pursuit that all should strive for but it is quite sad that the average person is moving away from these concepts and are becoming to show a lot of signs that society now is going to a low pain tolerance. It is rather so easy to have a mediocre life, but my argument against people not accepting that life is suffering will invariably code bad habits that can be passed on to their children and contribute to weaker society moving forward. This is what is pushing me to write more stuff even though I feel lazy and sleepy now and continously encoding the habit is the way forward. There is no alternative. There is no other option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"rationalstoiclogo.jpg\" alt=\"rationalstoiclogo\"></p>","excerpt":"Life is like how Elon described how doing business is - eating glass while staring in the abyss.
