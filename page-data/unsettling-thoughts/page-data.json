This blog is a step procedure or an attempt to understand each one of them as deep as possible..</em></strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Medical practitioners fighting a pandemic with limited data and infrastructure.</strong> Countries not able to implement rapid testing and quarantines have left their experts in scramble in handling the overwhelming number of cases. Since the unavailability of treatment magnifies the situation where in current resources are allocated to relieve current exposure or extend life until a person can heal through his/her own immune system. There is no drug or treatment yet approved for the corona virus disease and this primary problems posts our medical experts underhanded in the fight.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Poor countries unable to even just test and quarantine</strong> Whenever I pause to reflect, my understanding of how a poor country will be unable to guide itself in a very abstract problem like a pandemic makes me pessimistic a lot. People are goimg to die, at scale. Why do I say that? in the Philippines we are already encountering its initial effects and it needed Presdent Duterte to seek additional powers and resources just to make ends meet especially in the lack of medical infrastructure. Now imagine the poor and corrupt countries in west africa that lacks the needed leadership or the billions of poor in India without work so troubling just to write this analysis. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Acceleration of global warming.</strong> Taking out a significant portion of the Carbon dioxide we produce daily removes the pollutants ability to shield the world from ultraviolet rays and thus making the world warmer. This is the reason why there are tremendous push for new technologies to solve this problem. This topic is being less talked about in the mainstream and most think that we are making it more safer for the world in this process of removing this shield. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Psychological effects of the pandemic and mass stupidity in reaction to panic.</strong> There is tremendous stress in the way we do “normal” life and the average person tends to make poor decisions in tackling abstract problems. Also, the hyper-stressed medical infrastructures in countries like Italy and Spain are in a position that they are choosing who will live or die because of the limited number of respirators. We do not know the future implications of having our medical experts take these kinds of cognitive challenges, will they still be sane after the dust clears? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Modern economic collapse.</strong> Putting half of the world on lockdown posts tremendous stress in the stability of the world and breathes new problems. I for myself is kind of in the thinking of will we be earning a salary if this lockdown persist. Now each person in the countries that put their people out of a capacity to earn a living is now put in a crisis to earn and provide for their family. This may cause civil unrest, all over the world and breed more unecessary chaos.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Threat of war.</strong> The world now is watching as the European Union, United Kingdom and United States are in the process of fighting for survival. I just hope that the evil opportunistic mind of other nation states will not try to do a crazy move that will put the world out of order. Well, it is too early to tell or put a final dot to the story as we are still in the early stages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The uncertain future, this is what we all have now and unfortunately have too much time to think because of the lockdowns. As the world hang on the balance because of this pandemic and magnifying our current problems at hand especially the misinformation and global warming, my hope is we do find the heroes that can guide as through this. The medical practitioners I just mentioned above are considered heroic in this chaos that they will tackle in the coming months. We do not have a unified leadership to tackle a global and common problem. I bet at a community level, heroes will more likely to emerge. </p>","excerpt":"These are ideas that are currently troubling my mind for the past three weeks over this pandemic.
