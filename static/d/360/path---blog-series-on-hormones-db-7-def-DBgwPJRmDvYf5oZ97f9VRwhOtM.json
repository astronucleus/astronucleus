I believe this is a more better way of making sense of our limited time in this world. Blogging is a more intellectually stimulating routine looking at my friend’s photo. I wish most will be able to realize that engaging with this platforms wraps our brains with hormones that are very unnecessary for our health in general. Higher rates of suicide and to some degree I attribute obesity as a by-product of our generation being over exposed to advertisements of unhealthy food. </p>\n<p>I just hope it’s not too late for most. Quit social media now. </p>","excerpt":"I still have Whatsapp for work and friends from Ausralia & France, use Slowly to meet new people, use Twitter to follow people for knowledge…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/talking-homosapiens/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Blog Series on Hormones","tags":["talking-homosapiens","creating-art","blog"],"date":"April 22, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog-series-on-hormones/"}}
